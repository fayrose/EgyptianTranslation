a summary of the deeds of valour and strength
that this good god performed
consisting of every excelling deed of bravery since the beginning
of the first generation
which the lord of the gods the lord of armant did for him
magnifying his victories to let his valour be related
for millions of years to come
next to the deeds of bravery
that his majesty did continuously
if one were to recount a deed by its name
they would be too numerous to put into writing
when he shoots at a copper target
all wood is splintered like a papyrus reed
his majesty offered an example thereof in the temple of amun
with a target of hammered copper
of three digits in thickness
when he had shot his arrow there
he caused protrusion of three palms behind it
so as to cause the followers to pray for the proficiency of his arms
in valour and strength
im telling you what he did
without deception and without lie
in front of his entire army
and there is no word of exaggeration therein
when he spent a moment of recreation
hunting in any foreign land
the quantity that he captured was greater
than what the entire army achieved
he slew seven lions by shooting in an instant
he captured a herd of twelve wild bulls
in an hour at the time of breakfast
their tails behind him
he killed 120 elephants in the foreign country of niya
when he came from naharina
he crossed the river euphrates
and trampled the towns on its banks
which were destroyed by fire forever
he captured a rhinoceros by shooting in the southern land of taseti
after he had gone to miu
to seek out him who had rebelled against him in that land
he erected his stela there
his majesty didnt halt
while proceeding to the land of djahi
to slay the rebels who were there
and to give goods to those who were loyal to him
his majesty returned every time
his attack having succeeded with valour and strength
while he let egypt be in its state
as the first victory
it was his majesty who opened its road
and who explored its every way
his majesty entered upon that road
that was very narrow
at the head of his entire army
while all foreign lands were assembled
the enemy failed
and fled quickly to their town
his majesty came in joy
he of edfu great god lord of heaven
khons in thebes neferhotep
the king of upper and lower egypt lord of the two lands
usermare sotpenre

the king of upper and lower egypt lord of the two lands
usermare sotpenre
son of re of his body
ramesse beloved of amun
amun re lord of the thrones of the two lands
and of the ennead mistresses of thebes
good god son of amun offspring of re harakhti
glorious seed of the almighty
begotten by kamutef
king of the black land ruler of the red land
sovereign who seized the nine bows
whom victory was foretold as he came from the womb
whom valor was given while he was in the egg
bull stout hearted as he enters the arena
divine king going forth on the day of victory like month
one great of strength like the son of nut
when his majesty was in naharina according to his annual custom
the princes of every foreign land came bowing in peace
to the might of his majesty from as far as the marshlands
their gifts of gold silver lapis lazuli
turquoise and every kind of herb from the gods land were on their backs
and each one was outdoing his fellow
then the prince of bakhtan had his gifts sent
and placed his eldest daughter before them praising his majesty
and imploring life from him
the woman pleased the heart of his majesty very much more than anything
and her titulary was established as great royal wife nefrure
when his majesty arrived back in egypt
she did everything that a queen should do
it happened in year 15 second month of the season of harvest day 22
while his majesty was in thebes the victorious mistress of cities
performing the rites for his father amun re
lord of the throne of the two lands at his beautiful feast of luxor
his favourite place since the beginning
that one came to say to his majesty
there is a messenger of the prince of bakhtan
who has come with many gifts for the queen
then he was brought before his majesty with his gifts
and he said saluting his majesty
hail to you re of the nine bows
give us life from you
then he payed tribute to his majesty
and he went on to say to his majesty
i have come to you sovereign lord
on account of bentresh
the younger sister of queen nefrure
an illness has seized her body
may your majesty send a learned man to see her
and his majesty said
bring me personnel of the academy
and the council of the residence
and they were ushered in to him immediately
then his majesty said
look you have been summoned to hear this matter
now bring me a learned man
and excellent scribe from among you
then the royal scribe thothemheb came before his majesty
and his majesty ordered him to go to bakhtan with this messenger
the learned man then arrived in bakhtan
and found bentresh possessed by a spirit
he found him an enemy whom one could fight
then the prince of bakhtan went on to report to his majesty saying
day 4 during the feast of amun
while his majesty was in thebes
his majesty then reported to khons in thebes neferhotep saying
good lord i report to you concerning the daughter of the prince of bakhtan
then khons in thebes neferhotep proceeded to khons the provider
the great god who expels disease demons
then his majesty said to khons in thebes neferhotep
good lord will you turn your face to khons the provider
the great god who expels disease demons
making him go to bakhtan
a very strongly approving nod
then his majesty said
give your magical protection to him
and i will let his majesty go to bakhtan to save the daughter of the prince of bakhtan
a very strongly approving nod of the head
from khons in thebes neferhotep
then he created magical protection for khons the provider in thebes
four times
his majesty ordered that khons the provider in thebes be made to proceed
to the great barque with five boats a chariot and many horses on the right and left
this god arrived in bakhtan at the end of one year and five months
and the prince of bakhtan came with his army and his officials
before khons the provider
he placed himself on his belly saying
you have come to us to be merciful to us
as the king of upper and lower egypt usermare sotpenre has commanded
this god then went to the place where bentresh was
and created magical protection for the daughter of the prince of bakhtan
and she became well instantly
then this spirit who was with her said to khons the provider in thebes
welcome in peace
great god who expels disease demons
bakhtan is your home
its people are your servants
and i am your servant
i shall return to the place i came from
so as to set your heart at rest about what you came for
may your majesty command to spend a day of celebration
with me and the prince of bakhtan
then this god nodded approvingly to his prophet saying
let the prince of bakhtan make a great offering before this spirit
during this that khons the provider in thebes and the spirit did
the prince of bakhtan stood by with his army
and was very frightened
then he made a great offering
before khons the provider in thebes and the spirit
and the prince of bakhtan organized a day of celebration for them
then the spirit went in peace to where he wished
as khons the provider in thebes had commanded
the prince of bakhtan rejoiced very greatly
together with everyone in bakhtan
then he took counsel with his heart saying
i will let this god stay here in bakhtan
i will not let him go back to egypt
so this god spent three years and nine months in bakhtan
then as the prince of bakhtan was asleep on his bed
he saw this god come out of his chapel
he was a falcon of gold and flew to the sky toward egypt
he then awoke in fear
and said to the prophet of khons the provider in thebes
this god is here with us whereas he should go back to egypt
let his chariot go back to egypt
then the prince of bakhtan let this god proceed to egypt
and gave him very many gifts of every good thing
and very many soldiers and horses
they arrived safely in thebes
and khons the provider in thebes went
to the house of khons in thebes neferhotep
and placed the gifts that the prince of bakhtan had given him of every good thing
before khons in thebes neferhotep
without him giving anything thereof to his own house
khons the provider in thebes arrived safely at his house
in year 23 second month of the season of growing day 19
of the king of upper and lower egypt usermare sotpenre
may he be given life like re eternally
year 50 first month of the season of harvest day 22
under the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt menkheperre
given life
his majesty commanded the digging of this canal after his finding it blocked up with stones
a ship could not sail on it
he travelled north on it his heart being glad having slain his enemies
the name of this canal is
menkheperre may he live eternally is the one who opens the way as something perfect
it are the fishermen of elephantine who will dig out this canal every year
after he had exercised kingship
and mankind and gods were still united
mankind then conspired against him
while his majesty l.p.h. had grown old
his bones were of silver his flesh of gold and his hair of real lapis lazuli
his majesty perceived the conspiring that was done against him by mankind
and his majesty l.p.h. said to those in his retinue
summon to me my eye and shu tefnut geb nut
and the fathers and mothers who were with me
when i was in the primordial water
and also my god nun
and he shall bring his courtiers with him
bring them stealthily
so that mankind doesnt see and lose heart
come with them to the palace
so that they may give their excellent counsel
i shall return to the primordial water
to the place where i came into being
then these gods were brought
and these gods came at his two sides kneeling to the ground
before his majesty
that he might present his issue before the father of the eldest
who created mankind the king of the people
and they said to his majesty
speak to us that we may hear it
then re said to nun
o eldest god in whom i came into being
and ancestor gods
look mankind which issued from my eye
they have conspired against me
tell me what you would do about it
since i am deliberating
and i cannot slay them until i have heard what you might say about it
then the majesty of nun said
my son re god who is greater than he who begot him
and most august than they who created him
be seated
great is the fear of you
since your eye is on those who scheme against you
the majesty of re then said
look they have fled to the desert
because their hearts are fearful about what i said to them
and they said to his majesty
let your eye go that it may smite them for you
the schemers of evil
there is no eye that is more able than she to smite them for you
may it descend as hathor
this goddess returned after she had slain mankind in the desert
and the majesty of this god said
welcome in peace hathor who helped the creator
when i came to her
and this goddess said
as you live for me
i have overpowered mankind
and it was pleasure to my heart
and the majesty of re said
i shall take power over them as king
as he who diminished them
thus sachmet came into being concoction of the night
to wade in their blood as far as herakleopolis
then re said
summon to me swift nimble messengers
that they may rush like a bodys shadow
and these messengers were brought immediately
the majesty of this god then said
go to elephantine
and bring me haematite in great quantity
and this haematite was brought to him
then the majesty of this great god ordered
that the braided in heliopolis grind this haematite
while maidservants grind barley for beer
then the haematite was put into this beer mash
and it became like human blood
seven thousand jars of beer were made
then the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt re came
together with these gods
to see this beer
when the day dawned on which mankind would be slain
by the goddess
among their days of travelling south
the majesty of re said
how good it is
i will protect mankind against her
and re said
carry it to the place of which she had said i will slay mankind there
the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt re rose early
in the middle of the night
to have this sleeping potion poured out
and the fields were flooded three palms high with the liquid
by the might of the majesty of this god
then this goddess came in the early morning
and found that these fields were flooded
and her gaze was pleased by it
then she drank and it pleased her heart
after she returned drunk without having perceived mankind
the majesty of re said to this goddess
welcome in peace o gracious one
thus beautiful women came into being in momemphis
their tongues were not partial
concerning their opposing a briber
their tongues were not partial
i opened my mouth to my soul
that i might answer what he had said
this is much against me today
whereas my soul has not quarrelled with me before
it is more than exaggeration
it is like i am ignored
may my soul not depart
may it attend to me in this
he will not be guilty
that he will distance himself from my body
from a net of cord
and it will not happen due to him
that he flees on the day of suffering
look my soul is disobeying me
while i do not listen to him
is dragging me toward death
before i have come to it
and is throwing me on the fire to burn me up
without him suffering therein
he will stay close to me on the day of suffering
he should stand on yonder side
like a praise singer does
this is one who goes forth
as he has brought himself
my soul is ignorant about easing the misery that is due to life
and restrains me from death
before i have come to it
the west gives me pleasure
is it suffering
it is a turning point of life
trees fall
trample on evil
and cast aside my misery
may thoth declare concerning me the gods are satisfied
may khons defend me a true scribe
may re hear my utterance
stop the barque
may isdes defend me in the sacred hall
for my need is heavy
to to weigh it on my behalf
it is pleasant that the gods should eliminate the concealment of my body
what my soul said to me
are you not a man
you are alive
what do you achieve
if you are concerned about life
like a possessor of wealth
i would say to someone who is about to go
as to that burial
you are taken away from leaping around
without your taking care
every criminal will say
i will take you
when you are dead
but your name still lives
that is a resting place
attractive to the heart
the west is a harbour
if my soul listens to me
my neglectful brother
with his heart in accord with mine
he will prosper
i will make him reach the west
like someone in his pyramid
to whose burial a survivor has attended
i will create a breeze over your corpse
and you will make another soul in weariness envious
i will create a breeze
so that it will not be freezing
and you will make another soul who is hot envious
i will drink water at the watering place
i will heap up hay
and you will make another soul who is hungry envious
but if you restrain me from a death
in this form
you will not find a place on which you can rest in the west
be favourable my soul
my brother
to what will happen
an heir who will make offerings
and stand at the tomb shaft on the day of burial
will wish a bier
at the necropolis
my soul opened his mouth to me
that he might answer what i had said
if you would call burial to mind
it is heartache
it is bringing of tears
making a man sad
it is taking a man from his house
left on a hill
you cannot come up
to see the sun
those who built in granite
who constructed and completed beautiful pyramids
in perfect realization
when the builders became gods
their altars were bare
like those of weary ones
who are dead on a riverbank
for lack of a survivor
after the water has taken its toll
and sunlight as well
the fish of the waterside speak to them
listen to me
as it is good to listen to people
have a good time
and forget worries
a commoner cultivates his plot
he loads his harvest into a boat
and tows the transport
as his feast is near
and he sees the darkness of a north wind arise
he waits for a boat
as the sun sets and rises
and meanwhile his wife and his children
perish in a pond surrounded at night by crocodiles
at last he sits down
and argues
i do not weep for that mother
for whom there is no escape from the west
for another term on earth
but i will grieve for her children
who were crushed in the egg
who saw the face of khenty
before they had lived
a commoner asks for dinner
his wife says to him
it will be supper
he goes outside
until the moment that he returns to his house
he is like another man
his wife pleads with him
but he cant hear her
incapable of communication
i opened my mouth to my soul
that i might answer what he had said
my name reeks through you
more than the smell of bird droppings
on summer days
when the sky is hot
my name reeks through you
a haul of catfish
on a fishing day
when the sky is hot
my name reeks through you
more than the smell of ducks
more than a covert of reeds full of fowl
my name reeks through you
more than the smell of fishermen
more than the creeks of marshes they have fished
my name reeks through you
more than the smell of crocodiles
more than sitting on sandbanks of crocodiles
my name reeks through you
more than the smell of a wife
about whom a lie has been told involving a man
my name reeks through you
more than a diligent child
about whom is said he belongs to his rival
my name reeks through you
city of a sovereign that conspires to rebel
when his back is turned
whom can i talk to today
brothers are evil
and friends of today dont love each other
whom can i talk to today
hearts are greedy
and every man is stealing things from his fellow
kindness has vanished
and rudeness has descended upon everyone
whom can i talk to today
one is contented with evil
and goodness is cast on the ground
everywhere
whom can i talk to today
who should enrage a man by his ill deed
makes everyone laugh by his evil wrongdoing
whom can i talk to today
one steals
every man is robbing his fellow
whom can i talk to today
the villain is an intimate friend
and the brother with whom one dealt
has become an enemy
whom can i talk to today
yesterday is not remembered
one does not help now who has given help
whom can i talk to today
brothers are evil
and one turns to strangers
for honesty
whom can i talk to today
faces are blank
every man has his face downcast concerning his brothers
whom can i talk to today
hearts have become greedy
and there is no mans heart
on which one may rely
whom can i talk to today
none are righteous
and the land is left to evildoers
whom can i talk to today
an intimate friend is lacking
and one turns to a stranger
to complain to
whom can i talk to today
none is content there
and he with whom one walked
is no more
whom can i talk to today
im laden with misery
for lack of an intimate friend
whom can i talk to today
the evil that scourges the earth
is without end
death is in my sight today
a cure of a sick man
like going outside
after confinement
death is in my sight today
like the smell of myrrh
like sitting under a sail
on a windy day
death is in my sight today
like the smell of lotus flowers
like sitting on the shore of drunkenness
death is in my sight today
like a path washed by rain
like a mans coming home from an expedition
death is in my sight today
like the skys clearing
like a mans grasping thereby
what he didnt know before
death is in my sight today
like a mans longing to see home
after he has spent many years
in captivity
but who is there is a god who lives
because of punishing the evil of one who does it
but who is there stands in a barque
because of letting its choice offerings be given
to the temples
but who is there is a wise man
who cannot be turned away
because of appealing to re
following his word
what my soul said to me
put whining on a peg
o my comrade
my brother
may you give offerings upon a brazier
in order to reach for a life as you described
desire me here
and dismiss the west
but desire to reach the west
when your body is buried
i will alight when you become weary
and then well make harbour together

but the one mighty of strength overthrew them
the one with powerful arm who tramples his enemies
he is a king who fights alone
without crowds behind him
he is more effective than a million of numerous soldiers
no equal to him has been found warrior hero on the battlefield
in whose vicinity there is no resistance
who immediately overpowers all foreign lands
as commander of his army
while he rushes between the barbarians as a star that crosses the sky
who enters the turmoil of battle
while his glowing breath attacks them with fire
who eradicates them
while they lie in their blood
it is his serpent diadem that overthrows them for him
his flame that drives away his enemies
the numerous army of metjen was overthrown within an hour
as perished as those who have never been
as what the arms of the good god did
who is great of strength in battle
who carries out a massacre of everyone
his only leader the king of upper and lower egypt menkheperre
may he live forever
he is horus with a powerful arm a excellent fortress to his army
a refuge to the subjects
who attacks every land with infighting
who rescues egypt on the battlefield
a protector who does not fear the rapacious
he is a brave bull
whose southern borders reach to the crest of the world
to the ends of this world
and the northern to the ends of asia
to the supports of heaven
they come to him with bowed heads
seeking his breath of life
he is a king valiant like montu
who robs but from whom one cannot rob
who tramples all rebellious foreign lands
without there being anyone to protect them
in that land of naharina
which its lord had abandoned in fear
i damaged his towns and his people
and i set fire to them
my majesty turned them into ruins
so that they could not be reconstructed
i captured all their people
who were brought as prisoners
their cattle without limit
and their possessions as well
i took the crops away from them
tore out their barley
and felled all their trees and all their fruit trees
their districts were massacred
my majesty devastated them
now my majesty travelled to the ends of asia
i let many ships be constructed of cedar
on the hills of the gods land
in the presence of the mistress of byblos
and they were put on carts
pulled by oxen
they went before my majesty
to cross that great river
that flows between this foreign land and naharina
a king who is lauded for his arms in battle
he crossed the euphrates after him who had attacked him as chief of his army
foreign lands of metjen
but he fled from his majesty to another land
a distant place in fear
then my majesty erected my stela on that mountain of naharina
carved out of the mountain on the western side of the euphrates
there is no enemy of mine in the southern lands
and the northerners come bowing to my might
it is re who commanded it for me
for i have grasped all that his eye revolves around
he gave me the land in its length and its breadth
i tied up the nine bows
the islands in the middle of the ocean
the inhabitants of the aegean sea and the rebellious lands
i returned southward to egypt
and subjugated naharina
greatly feared in the mouths of the bedouin
their gates being closed because of it
and they couldnt go out for fear of the bull
he is a brave king an excellent fortress to his army
a castle of iron
he attackes every land with his strength
without millions of men behind him
a sure marksman
everytime he takes aim
whose arrows cannot miss
one with powerful arm the like of whom has never been
valiant montu on the battlefield
now another victory that re commanded for me
he again did for me a very brave act
at the lake of niya
he made me round up herds of elephants
my majesty hunted them a herd of 120
never had anything similar been done by a king
since the god of those who had received the white crown
i have said this without boasting and without lie
who guides my majesty on the good road
through his excellent plans
he united for me the black land and the red land
what the sun revolves around is in my grasp
now ill speak again to you so hear people
he conferred on me the foreign lands of retjenu
during the first expedition
as they came to engage my majesty
being millions of men
hundreds of thousands of the finest of all foreign lands
standing on their chariots
330 princes each one thereof with his army
they were in the valley of qina
ready for battle in a narrow defile
and a successful act took place against them caused by me
my majesty attacked them
and they fled immediately
falling in heaps
they entered megiddo
and my majesty besieged them for seven months
until they came out
beseeching my majesty saying
give us your breath our lord
the foreigners of retjenu will not rebel again
then that enemy and the princes who were with them had sent
to my majesty all their children
with many tributes of gold and silver
all their horses that were with them
their large chariots of gold and silver
and those that were undecorated
all their coats of mail
their bows their arrows
and all their weapons
this is what they had come with
to fight and conspire against my majesty
and now they brought them as gifts to my majesty
they stood on their walls giving praise to my majesty
in order to be given the breath of life
then my majesty ordered that they be made to swear an oath
we will not again do evil against menkheperre
may he live forever our lord
in our lifetime
for we have seen his might
he has given us breath as he wishes
it is not an act of people
then my majesty ordered that they be granted passage
to their towns
they all went on donkeys
since i had taken their horses
i captured their inhabitants for egypt
and their properties as well
my father gave them to me
whose plans do not fail
who sent my majesty to seize the lands and all foreigners together
i overthrew them as he ordered in the way that he used to do
he let me smite all foreigners
and there was none who dared approach me
my mace overthrew the asiatics
and my ams mace smited the nine bows
my majesty subjugated every land
retjenu is under my feet
the bedouin of asia are subject to my majesty
they are subservient to me as one
charged with tributes of millions of many things
from the crest of the world
and much gold from wawat
its quantity without limit
one constructs there for the palace l.p.h.
each and every year eight ships
the bedouin of asia in ivory and ebony
precious wood comes for me from kush
consisting in branches of doum palm
and furniture without limit of southern acacia
my army hewed them in kush
which was there by the millions
which my majesty had carried off in victory
from real cedar from lebanon
which is brought to the palace l.p.h.
precious wood comes for me to egypt brought south
the pick of the gods land
which were assigned
maa wood like alabaster for supply to the residence
without expiration of the coming of the appropriate season
of a single year
which is from cedar from conquests of my majesty
who conferred on me all foreigners
i didnt give of it to the asiatics
since it is wood that he likes
he subjugated and they acknowledge my lord
and the misery from them has been pacified
that is at the sacred mountain
which was called the thrones of the two lands among the people
when it wasnt known yet
before the people
to carry out the regular watch
there were two observers
a star fell falling to their south
the like had not happened before
it struck them opposite to him
none of them offered resistance
and none looked back
they no longer had horses
i returned southward my heart being glad
the one who had ordered this victory
he placed the fear of me among all foreigners
and they fled far away from me
all that the sun shines upon
is bound together under my feet
my majesty myself says
because i am very skilled in strength and victory
which my noble father amun lord of the thrones of the two lands has given to me
he has made me lord of the five portions
ruler of what the sun revolves around
fright of my majesty to the southern boundary marker
there is no road to me
since he has sealed the entire land for me
there is no limit to what became mine in victory
he placed my might in upper retjenu
to the place where my majesty is
at every season
the foreign land extracts for me everything good that is in it
which it had hidden from other kings
all kinds of precious stones
all kinds of sweet smelling herbs
that grow in punt
and everything good from the southern land
everything that comes before my majesty through trade is his
i fill his house
i will also give offerings precious goods
which his strong arm had attacked
he ordered it to me against all foreigners
the thrones of the two lands
the great god of the primordial time
the primeval god who created your beauty
he has given you every land
lead it for him who knows that you have come forth from him
fear of me in the ends of asia
without my messenger being hindered
all the gods of upper and lower egypt
to travel south therein
the southern land to the palace l.p.h.
the princes of retjenu dragged these flag poles
with oxen to the harbour
and they came with their tributes
to the place where his majesty was
with all good products that were brought
charged as tributes of the annual requirements
as all subjects of my majesty
your fame has pervaded the crest of the world
who will disrespect your plans
the king of upper and lower egypt nebtawire
may he live forever
this wonder that happened to his majesty
creatures from the hills came down to him

going with her face towards the people before her
while her eyes looked back
but she did not turn back
until she arrived at this august mountain
at this block
it being still in its place
for this lid of this sarcophagus
then she gave birth upon it
while this expedition of the king was watching
then her neck was cut
and she was sacrified on it as burnt offering
it descended safely
now it was the majesty of this august god

beginning of the teaching made by the leader of nobility foremost of action made by a man for his son
father of the god beloved of the god
master of secrets of the house of the king may he live flourish and be well
overlord of the land to its limit
sem priest controller of the kilted
as a teaching before his children
let me say what is great may you listen
as i cause you to know the manner of eternity
a matter of live in truth
of proceeding to revered status
praise the king within your bodies
embrace his agency in your hearts
spread awe of him every day
create rejoicing for him at every moment
he is the insight into what is in hearts
his eyes probe every body
he is the sun in whose leadership people live
whoever is under his light will be great in wealth
he is the sun by whose rays people see
he is the one who brightens the two lands more than the sun disk
his heat scorches more than the flame of the torch
he is more devouring in his moment than fire
he is more fertile than the great flood
he has filled the two lands with the trees of life
noses are blocked when he falls to raging
when he is peaceful people breathe his air
he grants provisions for anyone in his following
he grants provisions for anyone in his following
the one he favours will be a lord of offerings
the one he rejects will be a pauper
the servant of the king will have revered status
his opponants
it is his power that fights for him
slaughter is what spreads respect for him
watching over
founded upon the praise of his perfection
he opens up the creation
that his heart desires
it is the life that comes of giving him adoration
his opponants will be beneath
their corpses
sustenance is the king abundance is his word
he is one who creates in his being
he is the heir of every god
the champion of the one who fashioned him
they strike down his opponents for him
see his agency may he live flourish and be well is in his palace of life flourishing health
he is atum at the tying of necks
his protection is at the back of the giving of his powers
he is khnum for everybody
the begetter who brings the populace into being
he is bast she who protects the two lands
he is praised for his sheltering
he is sekhmet against the one who transgresses what he has ordered
the one whom he humbles will be bearer of travels
fight on his name
cleanse in his life
avoid the instant of sloth
the servant of the king will have revered status
but there can be no tomb for one who rebels against his agency
his corpse will be something cast into the water
do not hold back from the presents of his giving
revere the bee adore his white crown
worship the one who raises the double crown
as you do this your bodies will be well
you can find it to be so for eternity
enter the land by the gift of the king
content in the place of eternity
united with the cavern of the one within everlasting time
with the shrine of your children bearing your love
and your heirs established in your positions
copy my form do not neglect my words
put into effect the rule i have drawn up
speak then to your children
for the word has taught since the time of ra
i am a noble to be heard
whose lord has entered his reflections
do not pass by my form do not stray from my talent
avoid the instant of sloth
a son who hears will be without any evils
does not every plan succeed by it
you will be praising this after years
faithfulness to them assures success
another theme to guide your hearts
as something to good effect before your workers
be commanding with people collect your staff together
and fasten on the agency of those who do
it is people who bring what there is into being
we live as men who have by their labour
if there is a lack of it poverty takes power
it is positions that produce offerings
the one whose house is empty his foundation wavers
their voices strengthen the walls
the man who sleeps till dawn is the lord of a multitude
there can be no sleep for the lone man
a lion is not sent on a mission
there is no cow that can be tied to the wall
its voice would be like someone thirsty behind a well
more than fattened birds
the flood is desired and they find it
but there is no field for ploughing that creates itself
it is the tethered bull that strikes the dueller
anyone who is experienced in it is keen sighted
do not overwhelm the field labourer with work
a man who complains does he return to you next year
if he is alive there are his arms
but if you flay him his thoughts turn to homelessness
fix the produce levy according to the grain harvest
there can be no opportunity for riches for an evil man
his children do not find his residue
the hard man causes the end of his life
his children will not be devotees
affection will be for the one who passes him
there can be no heir for the mean spirited
a lord of followers is great in respect
the loud mouthed is an evil on the heart
it is the evil man who destroys his home ground
and the loved man for whom a city is founded
patience is the monument of a man
the man with power in a task turns about
does the cow reproduce for the hard man
a herdsman of evil brings misery to his cattle
fight for people in every way
they are the flock that is good for their lord
it is they who find what one lives on
so they are good too for burial
watch over your ka priests
if the son is lazy there is still the wab priest
the one called an heir is the one who does favour
initiate the noble and recite on his name
for doing is more useful to the doer than to the one for whom it is done
it is the nourished dead who protect the one who is on earth
may you perish
he who comes from the darkness
who creeps in
his nose behind him
his head averted
may he fail what he came for
may you perish
she who comes from the darkness
who creeps in
her nose behind her
her head averted
may she fail what she came for
have you come to kiss this child
i will not let you kiss him
have you come to cause silence
i will not let you put silence into him
have you come to hurt him
i will not let you hurt him
have you come to take him
i will not let you take him from me
i have provided his protection against you
the singer tjeniaa says

as you will not thirsty
because the great god has ordained
that you are on earth
in his favour
as you will not be turned back at the difficult place
in the favour of your city gods
you say
a royal offering of osiris
lord of abydos
great god
wenen nefer
a thousand of bread
beer
oxen
fowl
a mortuary offering
in festivity
for the spirit of
the keeper of the diadem
follower of the palace
nebipw sesostris
begotten by it
breath of the mouth is beneficial to the blessed
but it does not make one tired
and you will be everlasting as star in the sky
o living who are on earth
every scribe
every lector priest
and every official
who will pass this tomb chapel
as you wish that osiris is merciful to you
the lord of life
and the ruler of eternity
you say
a thousand of bread and beer
a thousand of oxen and fowl
a thousand of offerings
and sustenance
on the offering table
of the lord of eternity
for the spirit of
the archer neferenii
because it is more beneficial to him who does it than to him for whom it is done
breath of the mouth is beneficial to the blessed
but it does not make one tired
i am a blessed to whom one should listen
a good reward belongs to him who does it
you will not step on my clothes
and this peasant said
i shall do what you wish my way is good
and he went up higher
then this nemtinakht said
is my upper egyptian barley to be a path for you
and this peasant said
my ways are good
the bank is steep and the ways are under barley
for you block our path with your clothes
will you then not allow us to pass on the path
then one of the donkeys filled
its mouth with a wisp of barley
and this nemtinakht said
look i shall take away your donkey peasant
because it ate my barley
it will tread grain for its offence
this peasant then said
my ways are good
a single thing has been destroyed
i will buy my donkey back for 10 times the value
if you take it away for filling its mouth with a wisp of barley
now i know the lord of this district
it belongs to the high steward rensi son of meru
he is the one who restrains every thief in this entire land
shall i now be robbed in his district
then this nemtinakht said
is this not the proverb that people say
one mentions the name of a commoner
only on account of his lord
i am the one who is speaking to you
and it is the high steward whom you are referring to
then he took a rod of fresh tamarisk to him
and he thrashed all his limbs with it
took his donkeys away and drove them to his district
then this peasant proceeded to wail very loudly
on account of the wickedness of what was done to him
but this nemtinakht then said
do not raise your voice peasant
or you will go to the abode of the lord of silence
then this peasant said you beat me you rob my goods
and you even deprive me of the lament from my mouth
lord of silence may you give me back my things
so that i need not scream
to startle you
then this peasant spent a period of 10 days
pleading with this nemtinakht
but he did not pay attention to it
this peasant then went
to herakleopolis in order to plead
with the high steward rensi son of meru
he found him emerging from the door of his house
to step into his official boat
and this peasant said
may i be allowed to inform you
about this grievance
perhaps one may have a servant of your choice come to me
so that i may have him report to you about it
and the high steward rensi son of meru had
a servant of his choice go to him
and this peasant had him report back
about this entire matter
then the high steward rensi son of meru accused
this nemtinakht to the officials who were with him
but then they said to him
perhaps it is a peasant of his who went to someone else beside him
look that is what they do to peasants of theirs
who have gone to others beside them
that is what they do
is this a cause for punishing this nemtinakht
on account of a little natron and a little salt
if he is ordered to replace it then he will replace it
but the high steward rensi son of meru remained silent
he did not answer these officials
nor did he answer this peasant
then this peasant came
to plead with
the high steward rensi son of meru
he said
high steward my lord greatest of the great
leader of all that is not and all that is
if you go down to the lake of truth
you will sail on it with a fair wind
the bunt will not strip away your sail
your ship will not lag
no disaster will befall your rudder stock
your yards will not break
you will not founder when you land
no wave will carry you off
you will not taste the evil of the river
you will not see the face of fear
but shy fish will come to you
and you will catch fatted fowl
for you are a father to the orphan
a husband to the widow
a brother to the divorced
and an apron to the motherless
let me make your name in this land according to every good rule
leader free of greed
great one free of arrogance
destroyer of falsehood creator of truth
one who comes at the voice of the caller
i speak so that you will hear
do justice
praised one whom the praised praise
relieve the distress
for i am burdened
examine me i am at a loss
now this peasant said these words
in the time of the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt nebkaure justified
the high steward rensi son of meru then went
before his majesty and said
my lord i have found one of these peasants who is truly eloquent
his goods have been robbed
and he has come to plead with me about it
and his majesty said
as you wish to see me in health
you will delay him here
without answering anything he says
so that he keeps speaking remain silent
then it will be brought to us
in writing
so that we may hear it
but provide sustenance for his wife
and children
that one of these peasants comes here
is because his house is empty
furthermore provide sustenance for this peasant himself
you will let the provisions be given to him
without letting him know
that it is you who gave them to him
and he was given ten loaves of bread and two jars of beer every day
the high steward rensi son of meru gave them
but he gave them to a friend of his and it was he who gave them to him
then the high steward rensi son of meru sent a message
to the mayor of the wadi natrun
about making provisions for the wife of this peasant
consisting of three gallons of barley every day
then this peasant came to plead with him for a second time
and said high steward my lord greatest of the great
richest of the rich
whose great ones have one greater
whose rich ones have one richer
rudder of heaven beam of earth
plumb line that carries the weight
rudder do not deviate
beam do not tilt
plumb line do not swing awry
a great lord takes what is without owner
and robs only that
your possessions are in your house
half a litre of beer and three loaves of bread
what is it you expend to satisfy your dependants
a mortal man dies along with his underlings
or will you be a man of eternity
is it not wrong
a balance that is crooked the pointer of a balance that errs
a truly correct man who strays
look justice is fleeing from you
expelled from its place
officials are doing evil
the norm of speech is biased
and judges are carrying off what it seizes
this means that he who twists speech from its correct sense
is acting corruptly thereby
he who should give breath is suffocating on the ground
he who should rest is making people pant
the arbitrator is a cheat
he who should relieve distress is ordering its creation
the harbour is flooded
he who should punish injustice is doing evil
then the high steward rensi son of meru said
is what is on your mind of greater concern to you
than that my servant might seize you
but this peasant said
he who measures heaps of corn is pilfering for himself
he who fills for another is withholding from his amount
he who should govern according to the laws is ordering theft
who then will repel evil
he who should dispel weakness is acting corruptly
he who should correct another is being crooked
he who should reproach another is an evildoer
do you find anything for yourself
redress is short but evil is long
a good deed returns to its place of yesterday
this is the precept
act for him who acts to make him act
it is thanking him for what he does
it is parrying a thing before shooting
it is commissioning something from a craftsman
would that a moment would destroy
havoc in your vineyard
decimation of your birds
destruction among your water fowl
he who should see has turned blind
one who should hear deaf
and one who should lead has gone astray
basket have you not gone too far
why do you act against yourself
look you are strong and powerful your arm is strenuous
but your heart is greedy
and mercy has left you
how lamentable is the poor man you ruin
you are like the messenger of khenty
look you surpass the lady of pestilence
if something is not for you it is not for her
if something is not against her it is not against you
if you wont do it she wont do it
who possesses bread should be merciful
whereas brutality is for the criminal
theft suits those without belongings
things are robbed by a criminal
but an evil act of someone without need
is he not to be rebuked
it is self seeking
but you are sated with your bread
and drunk with your beer
and you are rich in every respect
while the face of the helmsman is forward
the ship deviates as it pleases
while the king is in the stateroom
and the helm is in your hand
evil is placed near you
my plea is long and the division is difficult
whats with him there
people say
create shelter so that your shore will be safe
for look your harbour is surrounded by crocodiles
may your tongue be truthful
so that you wont go astray
that organ in a man is his canker worm
dont speak falsehood
beware of officials
the judges are a fattened basket
speaking falsehood is their herbage
it lies light on their hearts
o wisest of all mankind
are you unaware of my case
relieve all distress on the water
look i am under way without a ship
rescue all who are drowning
save the shipwrecked
rescue me in the domain that is within your reach
and this peasant came
to plead with him for a third time
he said high steward my lord
you are re lord of heaven with your courtiers
everyone has a need for you like water
you are hapi who makes the meadows green
and restores mounds that have been ravaged
punish theft
and protect the poor
dont become a flood against the suppliant
beware of the approach of eternity
desire to last as is said
doing justice is breath for the nose
inflict punishment on him who ought to be punished
and none will surpass your rectitude
does the hand balance err
is the stand balance biased
is thoth lenient
then may you do evil
you should set yourself equal to these three
if the three are lenient then you must be lenient
do not answer good with bad
do not put one thing in place of another
the spoken word is more persistent than weed
to reach the smeller with its retort
the one who waters mischief to make deception grow
this is three times to induce him to act
steer according to the sail
withdraw the flood so as to do justice
be careful that you do not run aground while at the tiller
to straighten out the land is to do justice
do not speak falsehood for you are mighty
do not be light hearted for you are weighty
do not speak falsehood for you are the balance
do not be careless for you are the key
you are just like the balance
if it is crooked then you must be crooked
do not deviate but operate the rudder pull on the tiller rope
do not rob but act against the robber
a great one who is greedy is not really great
your tongue is the pointer of the balance
your heart is the weight and your lips are its arms
but if you shut your eyes to the impudent
then who will repel evil
look you are a dishonourable washerman
who is keen on destroying friendship
one who wrongs his confidant for his client
anyone who comes and supplies to him is his brother
look you are a ferryman who ferries across anyone who has the fare
a righteous man whose righteousness has crumbled
look you are the chief of a workhouse
who wont let an unemployed person through at once
look you are a hawk to the people
one who lives on defenceless birds
look you are a cook whose joy is to slaughter
and who is not touched by the gruesomeness thereof
look you are a herdsman
is it not bad for me then
that you cannot be prudent
may you become less like a ravenous crocodile
for shelter has vanished from the harbour of the entire land
hearer you do not really hear
but why do you not hear
now i have spoken out against the aggressor
and the crocodile retreats
but what is the gain thereof to you
the secret of the truth will be found
and falsehood will be cast on the ground
do not make provision for the following day
before it has come
since one cannot know what is going to happen in it
when this peasant had said these words
the high steward rensi son of meru
went to the entrance of the portal
and made two guards turn against him with whips
and they thrashed all his limbs therewith
then this peasant said
so the son of meru must go astray
since his face is blind to what he sees
and deaf to what he hears
and is straying from what it is reminded of
look you are a town without a mayor
like a meeting without a chairman
like a ship without a captain
like a gang without a leader
look you are a policeman who steals
a major who accepts bribes
a district overseer who should restrain robbery
but who has become a pattern for the criminal
and this peasant came to plead with him for a fourth time
and found him emerging from the gate of the temple of arsaphes
he said praised one
may arsaphes from whose temple you have come praise you
goodness has been harmed there is no accumulation of it
nor is there casting of falsehood on the ground
has the ferry sunk
who can be ferried across
when the one who should bring about the deed is unwilling
crossing the river on foot
a good crossing or not
now who can sleep till dawn
for obstructed are going by night travelling by day
and letting a man attend his truly good cause
look it is no use to tell you this
for mercy has left you
how lamentable is the poor man you ruin
look you are a hunter who slakes his desire
bent on doing what he wants
who harpoons hippopotami shoots wild bulls
catches fish and snares birds
yet there is none hasty of speech who is free of spluttering
and none light of heart who is weighty of thought
be tender hearted so that you will learn justice
suppress your choice for the good of him who enters humbly
for there is no brute who attains excellence
and there is no impatient man whom one turns to
let the eyes see so that the heart be informed
dont be haughty in proportion to your might
so that evil doesnt reach you
tolerate one misdeed and it will become two
it is the eater who tastes so one who is questioned replies
it is the sleeper who dreams
as for a judge who ought to be punished
he is a pattern for the criminal
fool look you are found out
ignoramus look you are questioned
bailer of water look you are noticed
helmsman dont let your ship go off course
giver of life dont let people die
destroyer dont let people perish
shade dont be as the blazing sun
shelter dont let the crocodile snatch
the fourth time already of pleading with you
shall i spend all day at it
and this peasant came to plead with him for a fifth time
he said high steward my lord
the nyw fisherman is killing jy fish
the fish spearer is harpooning awbbw fish
the dabhw fisherman is after paqr fish
the fisherman ravages the river
look you are the same
do not defraud a poor man of his property
a slight man whom you know
the belongings of a pauper are his breath
to take them away is to stop up his nose
you were appointed to hear cases
to judge between litigants
and to punish the robber
but look what you are doing is supporting the thief
you are trusted
yet you have become a transgressor
you were appointed to be a dike for the pauper
so take care that he doesnt drown
but look you are the lake that pulls him under
and this peasant came to plead with him for a sixth time
and he said high steward my lord
lord who eradicates falsehood
who creates truth and creates all goodness
who destroys evil
like when satiety comes and ends hunger
and clothes end nakedness
like when the sky becomes calm after a heavy storm
and warms all who are chilled
like fire that cooks what is raw
like water that quenches thirst
see with your own eyes
the arbitrator is a cheat
the appeaser is causing misery
and he who should mitigate is causing suffering
cheating diminishes justice so render good account
and justice will be neither insufficient nor excessive
if you acquire then give to your fellow man
for chewing is without merit
my anguish leads to separation
and my accusation brought departure
one cannot know what is in the heart
dont be negligent act at the accusation
if you sever who will join
the sounding rod is in your hand
a rod that makes waters accessible that have stayed behind during low tide
if a ship goes down it is looted
and its cargo perishes on the ground
at every embankment
you are educated enlightened and accomplished
but not for cheating
you act the same as everyone
and your environment is corrupt
molester of the entire land
the cultivator of wickedness is watering his garden with evil
to make his garden grow with falsehood
and to water everlasting doom
and this peasant came to plead with him for a seventh time
and he said high steward my lord
you are the helm of the entire land
the land sails in accordance with your command
you are the equal of thoth
who judges without being partial
my lord may you condone that a man calls upon you
concerning his just cause
dont be outrageous it is not for you
one who was happy becomes anxious
do not scheme for what has not yet come
do not rejoice in what has not yet happened
considerateness extends friendship
and dismisses an offence that happens
one cannot know what is in the heart
subverter of the law destroyer of rectitude
there will be no poor man alive
if justice does not attend to him when he is robbed
now my body is full of misery
and my heart is laden with grief
it comes from my body because of the condition thereof
it is the breach of a dike its waters pouring through
as my mouth opens to speak
so i have now plied my sounding rod
bailed my water
given vent to what was on my mind
and washed my dirty linen
my speech is done
and my misery has ended up before you
what more do you need
your neglect will lead you astray
your avarice will befool you
and your greed will make you acquire enemies
will you even find another peasant like me
or will the lazy petitioner be waiting at the door of his house
there is none silent whom you let speak
none sleeping whom you roused
none downcast whom you enlivened
none speechless whose mouth you opened
none ignorant whom you let know
none foolish whom you educated
yet officials should be people who dispel injustice
lords of goodness
craftsmen in creating what is
people who mend a severed head
and this peasant came to plead with him for an eighth time
and said high steward my lord
one sinks low through greed
a greedy man is without achievement
he achieves only failure
you are greedy but it does nothing for you
you steal but its of no benefit to you
you who should let a man attend his truly good cause
in fact your possessions are in your house
and your stomach is full
the barley brims over since it is so abundant
and its excess perishes on the ground
thief robber snatcher
the officials who were appointed to repel evil
should be shelters from the agressor
the officials who were appointed to eradicate falsehood
and the fear of you wouldnt permit appealing to you
you do not perceive my heart
the humble man who returns
to make a complaint to you
he cannot fear him to whom it is submitted
though no brother of his can be fetched to side against you
in the street
your plots of land are in the country
your earnings are in the estate
and your provisions in the storehouse
officials are giving to you
and you are still robbing
are you a thief
people are ushered in to you
troops being with you
for the division of plots of land
do justice for the lord of justice
whose justice has justice
pen papyrus palette of thoth
beware of doing evil
the goodness of a good man is good to him
but justice is for eternity
it goes down with him who does it to the necropolis
when he is buried
and earth envelops him
his name is not effaced on earth
and he is remembered on account of the goodness
this is the norm of the divine word
if it is a hand balance
then it is not crooked
if it is a stand balance
then it is not biased
look i will come
and another will come
so you should inquire
but do not respond as one who questions a humble man
do not attack one who cannot attack
you show no mercy you are not troubled
you do not destroy
nor do you give me a reward for this good speech
that comes forth from the mouth of re himself
speak justice and do justice
for it is mighty
it is great it is enduring
one will find its trustworthiness
it will lead to blessedness
can a balance be crooked
when it is its pans that weigh things
there can be no excess of rectitude
an evil deed cannot reach harbour
but the hindermost will reach land
so act accordingly
and your share of the cargo will be what you seize
at every embankment
it is known
and every man in your environment is corrupt
none sleeping whom you roused
uneducated whom you instructed
and the fear of you wouldnt permit me to appeal to you
to make his complaint
you cannot fear him who submits it to you
are giving gifts to you
are you a thief then
are people ushered in to you
troops being with you
for the division of plots of land
when goodness is good goodness is good indeed
the norm of the divine word
you do not flee
do justice to me
a balance cannot be crooked
and this peasant came to plead with him for a ninth time
and said high steward my lord
the tongue of people is their stand balance
and it is the hand balance that detects deficiency
and inflicts punishment on him who ought to be punished
one sets the standard after you
but the truth returns to correct it
truth is an aspect of falsehood
which means it is made to thrive
but it is not gathered in
when falsehood sets out it goes astray
it cannot cross in a ferry
and it cannot row
as for him who is enriched by it
he has no children and no heirs on earth
as for him who sails with it
he cannot reach land
his boat cannot moor in its harbour
dont be heavy you havent been light
dont delay you havent been swift
dont be partial
dont listen to the heart
dont disregard someone you know
dont be blind to someone who looks to you
dont fend off someone who appeals to you
may you abandon this neglect
and may your verdict be accounced
act for him who acts for you
and dont listen to anyone who is against him
summon a man concerning his just cause
there is no yesterday for the negligent
no friend for him who is deaf to truth
and no holiday for the greedy
the accuser becomes wretched
wretched to be a suppliant
and the opponent becomes a murderer
look i am pleading with you
but you do not hear it
i will go and plead concerning you with anubis
then the high steward rensi son of meru sent two guards
to bring him back
and this peasant was afraid
thinking it was done to punish him
on account of these words that he had said
and this peasant said
a thirsty mans approach of water
the reach of a nurselings mouth for milk
such is death
for him who prays to see it come
when his death comes tardily for him
then the high steward rensi son of meru said
dont be afraid peasant
look you will arrange the matter with me
but this peasant swore an oath
so i will eat your bread
and drink your beer forever
the high steward rensi son of meru said
now wait here
and hear your petitions
and from a new papyrus roll he had every petition read out
according to its content
then the high steward rensi son of meru delivered them
to the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt
nebkaure justified
and they pleased his heart
more than anything in this entire land
then his majesty said
pass judgement yourself son of meru
and the high steward rensi son of meru sent two guards to fetch nemtinakht
then he was brought
he found six persons
this was copied from start to finish as found in writing
there was a man called khunanup
he was a peasant of the wadi natrun
and he had a wife called meret
this peasant said to this wife of his
look i am going to egypt
to fetch provisions there for my children
go and measure for me the barley
that is in the barn as the remainder of yesterdays barley
then he measured for her
six heqat of barley
then this peasant said to this wife of his
but prepare for me the six heqat of barley
as bread and beer for every day
so that i shall live on it
then this peasant left for egypt
after he had loaded his donkeys
with vine
purple nutsedge
natron
salt
pieces of wood from farafra
hides of panthers
skins of golden jackals
pondweed
anw stone
tnm plants
wild carrot
serpentine
mjswt plants
ochre
wild mint
hedge plants
pigeons
narw birds
gutted fish and plucked fowl
wbn plants
tbsw shrubs
gngnt beans
fenugreek
and anise
abound with all good products of the wadi natrun
this peasant then went south to herakleopolis
and he arrived in the district of per fefi
to the north of mednit
he came across a man standing on the embankment
his name was nemtinakht
and he was the son of a man called isry
these were liegemen of the high steward rensi son of meru
and this nemtinakht said
when he saw the donkeys of this peasant
which were desirable to his heart
would that i had some divine image
with which i could rob the goods of this peasant
now the house of this nemtinakht was at a waterside path
that was narrow it was not broad
it measured the width of a loincloth
its one side was under water
the other under barley
this nemtinakht then said to a servant of his
hurry and bring me a cape from my house
and it was brought to him immediately
then he spread it out on the waterside path
so that its hem came to rest on the water
and its selvage on the barley
and this peasant came on the public path
this nemtinakht then said
beware peasant
but look your donkey
is eating my barley
to your fearsomeness
this peasant then went south
then this peasant came
to plead with him
for the first time
high steward my lord great one lord of the great
cast evil on the ground
relieve my distress
for i am laden with sorrow
and faint from it
in distress
by a man who is my peer
so that his speech will be brought to us
in writing
but provide sustenance for the wife of this peasant
provide sustenance for this peasant himself
without him knowing
they were given to friends of his
and his friends gave them to him
then the high steward rensi son of meru gave provisions
he gave them to friends of his
and his friends gave them to him
look i am laden with sorrow
look i am in your hands
so you should take account of me
look i am in distress
words said by amun re
lord of the thrones of the two lands
may you come to me and rejoice at seeing my beauty
my son my avenger menkheperre may he live forever
i shine for your sake
my heart is glad
about your beautiful arrival at my temple
my hands have endowed your body with protection and life
how pleasant is your grace to my breast
i established you in my sanctuary and i performed wonders for you
i gave you valour and strength against all foreign lands
i put your authority and fear of you in all lands
and dread of you as far as the four supports of heaven
i increased awe of you in every body
i put the fame of your majesty throughout the nine bows
the princes of all foreign lands are gathered in your grasp
i stretched out my own hands
and i bound them for you
i tied up the nubian nomads by tens of thousands and thousands
and the northerners by hundreds of thousands of captives
i made your enemies fall under your feet
so that you could crush the contentious and deceitful
for i entrusted the earth to you in its length and its breadth
and westerners and easterners are under your command
you trample all foreign lands
while your heart is glad
there is no one who dares come near to your majesty
but while i was your guide
you attained them
you crossed the water of the euphrates of naharina
with strength and might that i created for you
they heard your battle cry and hid in holes
i deprived their noses of the breath of life
i set the dread of your majesty in their hearts
my serpent diadem on your head consumes them
it makes easy prey of the evil minded
it devours the aegean islanders with its flame
it severs the heads of the asiatics
and none of them is spared
the enemy staggers because of its might
i let your power pervade all lands
the light of the uraeus is your protection
there will be no rebel against you in what heaven surrounds
they come bearing tributes on their backs
bowing to your majesty as i commanded
i let the aggressors who come near you become weak
with fearful hearts their bodies trembling
i came to let you crush the princes of palestine
spreading them out under your feet throughout their lands
and to let them see your majesty as the lord of radiance
while you shine before them in my likeness
i came to let you crush those in asia
and strike the heads of the asiatics of retjenu
and to let them see your majesty equipped with your regalia
while you carry weapons on a chariot
i came to let you crush the eastern land
and trample those in the districts of the gods land
and to let them see your majesty as shooting star
which sheds its flame in fire and emits its fragrance
i came to let you crush the western land
keftiu and isy being in awe of you
and to let them see your majesty as a young bull
stout hearted sharp of horns invincible
i came to let you crush the aegean islanders
the lands of metjen trembling for fear of you
and to let them see your majesty as a crocodile
lord of fear in the water unapproachable
i came to let you crush those on the turtle backs
the sea people hearing your battle cry
and to let them see your majesty as avenger
appearing on the backs of his victims
i came to let you crush libya
the islands of the people of wetnet being in the power of your might
and to let them see your majesty as a wild lion
while you turn them into corpses throughout their valley
i came to let you crush the boundaries of the world
what the ocean surrounds being enfolded in your grasp
and to let them see your majesty as possessing the wings of horus
who takes what he sees at will
i came to let you crush the border people
and fetter the bedouin as captives
and to let them see your majesty as an upper egyptian jackal
lord of speed runner rover of the two lands
i came to let you crush the nubian nomads
who are in your grasp as far as shat
and to let them see your majesty as your two brothers
whose hands i joined together for you in victory
i placed your two sisters as protection behind you
and the arms of my majesty are raised warding off evil
i gave you protection
my son my beloved horus mighty bull who appears in thebes
tuthmosis may he live forever
who does for me all that my spirit desires
you have erected my sanctuary as a work of eternity
made longer and wider than before
his beauty adorns amun re
your monuments are greater than those of any king who has been
i commanded you to make them
and i am satisfied with them
i established you on the horus throne for millions of years
so that you may lead the living forever
beginning of the collection of fine words
said by the man of the elite foremost of arm
gods father and beloved of the god
eldest son of the king of his body
overseer of the city vizier ptahhotep
in teaching the ignorant to be wise
according to the rules of fine words
something useful to whoever heeds
and something harmful to whoever transgresses it
then he addressed his son
do not be proud on account of your knowledge
but discuss with the ignorant as with the wise
the limits of art cannot be delivered
there is no artist whose talent is fulfilled
fine words are more sought after than greenstone
but can be found with the women at the grindstone
if you meet an opponent in his moment
a director of heart who is superior to you
bend your arms and bow
do not take up your heart against him
for he will not be swayed for you
you can belittle bad speaking
by not clashing with him in his moment
it will mean he is called a fool
when your self restraint has subdued his excess
if you meet an opponent in his moment
your equal a man from your levels
silence is how you establish your superiority over him
while he is bad mouthing
greatly to the disgust of the assessors
and your name is the good one in the mind of the officials
if you meet an opponent in his moment
who is a poor man and not your equal
do not vent your heart on him by his wretchedness
put him on land for him to oppose himself
do not pour out your heart at the man facing you
the demolition of a wretched heart is a difficult matter
what you wish will be done
beat him with the hostility of the officials
if you are to be among leaders
at a command for the condition of the multitude
seek out for yourself every effective moment
until your condition reaches faultlessness
what is right is great and what is keen endures
it has not been overturned since the time of osiris
the one who overlooks laws is punished
that is what is overlooked in the sight of the greedy
it is the small minded that seize riches
but crime never managed to land its rewards
whoever says i snare for myself
does not say i snare for my needs
the final part of what is right is its endurance
of which a man says that is my father
do not cause fear among people
god punishes with the same
anyone who says i can live by it
will lack bread for his statement
anyone who say i can be powerful
will have to say i snare against myself by my cleverness
anyone who says he will strike another
will end by being given to a stranger
if you are a man at a sitting
at the table place of one greater than you
take whatever he causes to be set before you
do not stare at what is before him
do not pierce it with many glances
pressing it is an offence to the ka
do not speak to him until he has requested
you never know what may displease
speak when he questions you
and your speech will please
a great man when he is at a meal
behaviour following the command of his ka
he will give to the one he favours
that is the night time behaviour that happens
only a fool complains about it
if you are a man of entry
sent by official to official
be precise in the form he sent you
carry out the mission for him as he says
guard against harming with words
embroiling official with official
grasp what is right by its likeness
an outburst of the heart is not repeated
from the speech of all people
if you plough for plants on the margins
the god grants it to be great by your hand
do not inflate your mouth beside your neighbours
to inspire awe by being silent is greater
a master of character who is master of wealth
he seizes like a crocodile in the council
do not scorn the childless man
do not bemean by boasting over it
even a father can have his plenty of grief
a mother who has given birth may be less happy than a maid
it is the lone man that the god fosters
while the lord of a clan may beg to be followed
if you are weak follow a man of excellence
and all your conduct will be good before god
when you have known lesser men before
do not be proud against him
from what you knew of him before
respect him according to what he has become
for goods do not come of their own accord
this is their law for their desire
an overflow he has assembled it of himself
it is the god who makes him excellent
and protects him while he sleeps
follow your heart as long as you live
do not make a loss on what is said
do not subtract time from following the heart
harming its time is an offence to the ka do not deflect the moment of every day beyond establishing your heart
as things happen follow your heart
there is no profit in things if it is stifled
if you are a man of excellence
and produce a son in the favour of god
if he follows precisely the outline of your character
and ties your things to their proper place
do everything good for him
for he is your son he belongs to the shooting of your ka
do not separate your heart from him
seed may make a disputant
if he wanders and breaks your advice
and has rebelled against all that is said
and his mouth wanders into evil speech
battle him in all his words
he who attacks you is the one they have condemned
it means it was decreed that he be smjtten in the womb
their guidance does not stray
their stranded never find a ferry
if you are in the approach hall
stand and sit at every step
as was ordered to you on the first day
do not waver that causes your expulsion
the sight of the one who enters to report is keen
the space of the one he has summoned is broad
the approach hall follows regulations
every move according to the measure
it is the god who promotes a place
those who push forward are not made
if you are to be with people
appoint for yourself people you can trust
and be trustworthy
the man without speech running through his body
is the one who becomes a commander himself
a master of goods what is he like
your good name is that you do not speak
your body is fattened for you more than your contemporaries
you receive praise from those you do not know
when a heart heeds only its belly
it puts resentment of it in place of love of it
his heart is afflicted his body unkempt
the great of heart is the gift of god
the one who obeys his body belongs to the enemy
report your matters without hesitating
give your advice in the council of your master
anyone fully fluent in speaking
will find no difficulty in being a messenger in reporting
no one will contest but who can know it
it is the one who exceeds his field who comes unstuck
if he intends to prevail by it
he has to be silent at the words i said so
if you are a leader
with broad scope in what is commanded to you
you should do outstanding things
so as to be remembered in days to come
a case does not arise out of the midst of praises
the hidden beast intrudes and then there is resistance
if you are to be a leader
be patient in your hearing when the petitioner speaks
do not halt him until his belly is emptied
of what he had planned to have said
the victim loves to sate his heart
even more than accomplishing what he came for
if a petition is halted
people say but why did he break that rule
not everything for which he petitions can come to be
but a good hearing is soothing for the heart
if you wish friendship to last
within a house you may enter
as master as brother or as friend
anywhere you may enter
resist approaching the wife
it is not good for the place where it is done
it is not clever to open it up
a thousand men are tied against what is good for them
a little moment is like a dream
but death is reached by knowing it
it is a vile twist to shoot the enemy
it comes out on his doing the heart restraining him
the one who fails by lusting for her
no plan succeeds by his hand
if you wish your conduct to be good
and to save yourself from all evil
resist the opportunity of greed
it is a sore disease of the worm
no advance can come of it
it embroils fathers and mothers
with mothers brothers
it entangles the wife and the man
it is a levy of all evils
a bundle of all hatefulness
the man endures whose guideline is right
who proceeds according to his paces
he can draw up a will by it
there is no tomb for the greedy hearted
do not be greedy over a share
do not be jealous of what is not your due
do not be greedy against your kin
the mild man receives more respect than the strong
the one who goes out under his kin is a miserable man
deprived of the profit of speech
a fraction of the object of greed
creates a quarreler out of a cool temperament
if you are excellent found your household
love your wife within reckoning
fill her belly clother her back
ointment is the remedy for her body
gladden her heart as long as you live
it is a field of benefit for its lord
do not impose her in affairs
distance her from power restrain her
her eye is her storm when it sees
this is what keeps her in your house
your quelling her is water
the womb puts her in her arms
in her turmoil a canal is made for her
tp aqw=k m xprt n=k make your staff happy with what has come to you
it has come to one whom the god favours
anyone neglecting the happiness of his staff
is called a spirit of hoarding
no one knows what is coming when planning tomorrow
the spirit of the correct man is the spirit that brings happiness
if moments of praising arise
it is the staff who would cheer
food cannot be brought to town
staff are fetched when there is shortage
do not repeat slander
and do not listen to it
it is the result of the hot headed
repeat a word after seeing
not heard entirely skewed
see what is before you is fine knowledge
when a levy is decreed to take place
the one made to exact it is hated by law
slander is like a moment of dreaming
see what is the remedy for the dream
concealment
if you are as a man of excellence
sitting in the council of his master
rally every heart to excellence
your silence is more benefit than creeping talk
you should say what you know how to explain
there are artists of words in the council
speaking is more difficult than any labour
the one who can explain is the one who makes it work
if you are powerful in causing respect for you
by knowledge by calming in speech
do not order people except by the guidelines
the aggressive man ends up in trouble
do not have your heart too high or it will be brought down
do not stay silent if it makes you stumble
when you answer the speech of a fiery man
distance your sight restrain yourself
the spear of a hothead flies past
but a fine mover has his path smoothed
a man who worries all day long
will never be allowed a good moment
a man who lazes all day long
will never have a solid house
a shot filled is like an oar abandoned on the ground
when another is taken
his heart has obeyed the wish if only i had
do not block the moment of a great man
do not constrain the desire of one who is laden down
barriers from him arise against the one who disputes with him
there is release for the ka with the one who shows love for him
this is the gift of sustenance this and the god
what he loves is action for him
when the face is turned back to you after a storm
there follows peace before his ka
and barriers before the enemy
planting love brings sustenance
instruct the great in what is useful for him
foster his image in the sight of people
cause his wisdom to fall in front of his lord
and there may be rewards for you too before his ka
the stomach of the loved will be content
your back will be clothed by it
his image will be over you for the life of your house
your noble the one you love
he is alive by it
when he makes a good gesture do not be silent
this is indeed the guarantee of your love in the body of those who love you
see it is the ka that loves to listen
if you play the son of a man of a council
a messenger for pleasing the multitude
select the fringes of action
in speaking do not take sides
in case he speaks his opinion
officials he sets the case on that side
and your mistake is turned into judgement
if you show mercy on a past failure
incline to a man for his virtue
pass over him do not recall it
since he might stay silent for you on day one
if you are rich after your impoverishment
and acquire property after lack of it
in the city that you have known
with awareness of what happened to you before
do not place your trust in your wealth
it came to you by the gifts of the god
so you will not be behind another like you
but the same could happen to him
bend your back to your superior
your overseer of the kings domain
and your house will be fixed on its goods
your rewards in their place
the man who struggles with the superior is an irritant
you live as long as the superior is pleased with you
the shoulder is not injured by being exposed
do not seize the house of neighbours
do not suppress anything close to you
it gives no results in anything
let him not speak ill of you before you have heard
a troublemaker is a man with no mind
whoever is known as a quarreller
there is trouble for the struggler in places near to him
do not have sex with a child woman
when you knew the approach to the water of its chest
there is no cooling what is in his body
do not go mad on making the approach
he is cool after damaging his heart
if you seek out the character of a friend
do not make your own enquiries go direct to him
make the case with him alone
to avoid suffering in his matter
debate with him after a period of time
and try his heart in the matter of the case
if what he has seen come out through him
and he does the matter that angers you about him
or that makes him a friend
do not seize the sight
be collected do not deluge him with words
do not reply with a slight
do not react against him by destroying him
his moment cannot fail to come
no one can escape from what is fated for him
let your face be bright as long as you live
whoever leaves the store cannot enter
it is the bread of sharing that causes envy
a man with an empty stomach is a man to complain
the opponent is born out of impoverishment
do not make him into someone to approach you
favour is the memory of a man
in the years after ruin
know your plumage and your property will last
do not be mean in your character towards your friends
they are his river field when it floods more important than his riches
they are the property of one for another
the quality of a son of a someone is good for him
good character will be remembered
punish from the head teach by character
the force against a criminal will be a model example
any instance except for results
is what makes a moaner turn into an active opponent
if you marry a good time girl
a joyful woman known to her town
if she is wayward
and revels in the moment
do not reject her but instead let her enjoy
joyfulness is what marks calm water
if you heed these things that i have told you
all your conduct will move forward
their holding true that is their wealth
the memory of them moves in the mouth of people
from the excellence of their phrasing
when every saying has been brought
it does not perish in this land forever
doing it is a matter for goodness
the words of the officials follow it
this is the teaching of a man to speak to posterity
hearing it he becomes an attentive craftsman
it is good to speak to posterity for it will hear it
if there good cases arise from the one who is the superior
he will be eternally effective
all his wisdom will last forever
the wise man nourishes his soul
by establishing his goodness with it on earth
the wise man is famed for what he has learned
it is the official who is after good conduct
from the action of his heart and his tongue
his lips are reliable when he is speaking
and his eyes in seeing
his ears intent in hearing what is useful for his son
who does what is right is free from falsehood
hearing is good for a son who hears
hearing enters into the hearer
the hearer becomes one who is heard
hearing is good as speech is good
the hearer is the master of what is useful
hearing is good for the hearer
hearing is better than any other thing
love of good comes into being
how beautiful it is when a son receives what his father says
old age is achieved for him by it
the hearer is one whom the god loves
the one whom god hates does not hear
the heart is the creator of its master
do not hear from the one who does not hear
a mans heart is his life prosperity and health
it is the hearer who hears the speaker
the one who acts according to what is said is the one who loves hearing
how good when a a son listens to his father
how joyful is the one to whom this is said
a son who is handsome is a hearing lord
the hearer to whom it is said is effective in the body
memory of him is in the mouth of the people
those who are on earth and those who will be
if the son of a someone receives what his father says
there can be no wavering for any of his plans
instruct your son to be a good hearer
who will be excellent in the hearts of the officials
guiding his mouth according to what he has been told
seen as a hearer
the son who excels his steps are distinguished
but there is no straight way in for the one who fails to hear
the morning of the wise man will be his security
while the fool is pressed down
as for the fool unable to hear
nothing can ever be done for him
he sees wisdom as ignorance
and what is good as what is painful
he commits every error
to be accused of it each day
he lives on what one dies of
corrupt speech is his food
his character in this is well known to the officials
saying living death each day
his faults are passed over
from the sheer number of faults on him each day
a son who hears is a follower of horus
it is good for him after he hears
in his old age he achieves revered status
he can tell the same to his children
renewing the teaching of his father
every man teaches by his deeds
he tells on to the children
and they can tell their children
show character do not pass on your weaknesses
securing what is right is the life of your children
as for the principal who arrives with wrongdoing
people say what they see
that is exactly how that man is
to say to those who will hear
that is exactly how that man is too
there everyone sees and the multitude is pacified
there is no profit in riches without them
do not remove a word do not add it
do not put one in place of another
fight against opening up the bonds on you
guard against a man of experience saying
listen up if you wish to be secure
in the mouth of those who hear
wj=k aq .n=k m sp n hmww speak up when you have penetrated the case of the craftsman
you speak at the case of closure
and all your plans will fall into place
flood your heart restrain your mouth
then your plans will be among the officials
be straight in character before your lord
do as he has said that is the son
so those who hear it say
indeed favour gave birth to him
say things of distinction
so the officials who hear may say
how perfect is the issue of his mouth
do as your master has said for you
how good is one instructed by his father
when he emerged from him out of his body
and he told him while he was in the body entirely
may what he has done be greater than what he was told
see a good son by the gift of the god
surpassing what he was told before his lord
he does what is right
his heart has acted according to his set steps
as you reach me your body intact
the king content with everything
take years of life
what i have done on earth is not little
i took 110 years of life
by the grant of the king to me
favour ahead of the ancestors
from doing what is right for the king until the stage of revered status
this is its completion from beginning to end as found in writing
instruction of
the leader of the city and vizier ptahhotep
under the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt isesi may he live forever until eternity
the leader of the city and vizier ptahhotep says
sovereign my lord
infirmity has developed old age has befallen
feebleness has come weakness is renewed
one sleeps as a child every day
the eyes are weak the ears have become deaf
strength is waning through the tiredness of my heart
the mouth is silent and cannot speak
the mind has stopped and cannot remember the day before
the bones hurt because of the high age
good has turned into evil
all taste has gone
what old age does to people
is evil in every respect
the nose is blocked and cannot breathe
because of the difficulty of standing and sitting
may this humble servant be ordered to appoint a staff of old age
so that i may tell him the words of those who have heard
the counsels of the ancestors
who once listened to the gods
may the same be done for you
may suffering be driven away from the people
and may the two banks serve you
and the majesty of this god said
instruct him in the words of the past
so that he will be a model for the children of officials
may hearing enter him and all sincerity
speak to him
for none is born wise
who is loved by his city god
and the king in his time
and who will pass this stela
he will say
a thousand of bread
beer
oxen
and fowl
for the revered
the overseer of the seal makers

a good ruler who does what is beneficial to his father and all gods
he has restored what was in ruins
as monuments of eternal age
he has dispelled injustice throughout the two lands
and justice was established in its place
he lets falsehood be an abomination
and the land as in its primordial time
now when his majesty arose as king
the temples of the gods and goddesses
from elephantine to the lagoons of the delta
their shrines had fallen into decay
their sanctuaries were as if they had never existed
their temples were foot paths
the land was in distress
the gods were turning away from this land
if an army was sent to palestine
to widen the borders of egypt
no success of theirs came about at all
if one prayed to a god to ask a thing of him
he wouldnt come at all
similarly if one prayed to any goddess
she wouldnt come at all
their hearts were weak in their bodies
they destroyed what had been built
after some days had passed after this
his majesty appeared on the throne of his father
and he ruled the banks of horus
the black land and the red land were under his dominion
and every land was bowing to his might
now his majesty was in his palace which is in the house of aakheperkare
like re in heaven
and his majesty was executing the plans of this land
and the governing of the two banks
then his majesty took counsel with his heart
seeking every excellent deed
searching what was beneficial to his father amun
fashioning his noble image of real electrum
he surpassed what had been done before
he fashioned his father amun on thirteen carrying poles
his sacred image being of electrum lapis lazuli turquoise
and every kind of precious stone
whereas formerly the majesty of this noble god had been on eleven carrying poles
he fashioned ptah south of his wall lord of ankh tawi
his noble image being of electrum on eleven carrying poles
his sacred image being of electrum lapis lazuli turquoise
and every kind of precious stone
whereas formerly the majesty of this noble god had been on seven carrying poles
and his majesty built monuments for the gods
fashioning their statues of real electrum
from the best of the foreign lands
building their sanctuaries anew
as monuments of eternal age
endowed with property forever
setting aside offerings for them as daily sacrifices
providing their sacrificial bread on earth
he surpassed what had been before
he outdid what had been done since the time of the ancestors

sons of noted men whose names were well known
he multiplied their alters with gold silver bronze and copper
without limit of anything
he filled their workhouses with male and female slaves
brought as booty of his majesty

doubled trebled and quadrupled
with silver gold lapis lazuli turquoise
and every kind of precious stone

doing what their spirits like
so that they may protect egypt

i established my border further south than my forefathers
i added to what was bequeathed to me
i am a king who speaks and acts
i make happen what i conceive
eager to seize
hasty to succeed
in whose heart a matter doesnt slumber
anticipating inferiors
suppressing mercy
merciless to the enemy who attacks him
who attacks one who would attack
who is silent when one is silent
who replies to a matter as befits it
for to be idle after an attack
is to strengthen the heart of the enemy
aggression is valour
and retreat is cowardice
who is driven from his border is truly a coward
for the nubian listens to the word of mouth
answering him is making him retreat
if one acts aggressively towards him he turns his back
retreat and he will take occasion to act aggressively
for they are not respectable people
they are wretches with broken spirits
my majesty has seen them
it is no lie
i captured their women
i carried off their underlings
went to their wells
drove off their bulls
tore out their barley
set fire to it
as my father lives for me
i speak truthfully
there is no boast
that comes from my mouth
as for any son of mine
who shall maintain this border that my majesty established
he is my son born to my majesty
it befits a son that he be the champion of his father
and maintains the border of his begetter
as to him who shall lose it
who shall not fight for it
he is not my son
he was not born to me
now my majesty had a statue of my majesty made
at this border that my majesty established
so that you may be persistent at it
and that you may fight for it

may it please you
count
we have reached home
the maul has been taken the mooring post has been driven in
and the prow rope has been thrown on land
praise is given and the god is thanked
every man is embracing his fellow
and our crew has come back safe
without loss to our expedition
we reached the end of wawat
and passed biga
and now we have come back safely
our land we have reached it
listen to me count
i am free from exaggeration
wash yourself put water on your fingers
then you may reply when you are addressed
speak to the king with self possession
and answer without stammering
the utterance of a man saves him
his speech gains him indulgence
you do as you wish
it is tiresome to speak to you
i shall recount to you something similar which happened to me myself
i had set off for the mining region of the sovereign
and i had gone to sea
in a boat 120 cubits long
and 40 cubits wide
with 120 sailors of the pick of egypt
whether they looked at the sky or looked at the land
they were more courageous than lions
they could foretell a gale before it came
and a thunderstorm before it happened
a gale came up while we were at sea
before we had reached land
the wind rose and rose again
and a wave with it of 8 cubits
it was a beam that broke it for me
then the boat sank
and of those aboard none remained
then i was cast on an island
by a wave of the sea
i spent three days alone
my heart being my companion
and i slept in a shelter of wood
embracing the shadows
then i stretched my legs
to learn what i might put in my mouth
i found figs and grapes there
and all kinds of fine vegetables
unripe sycamore figs were there as well as ripe ones
and muskmelon as if cultivated
fish were there as well as fowl
there was nothing that was not on it
then i ate my fill
and dropped on the floor because of the abundance on my arms
i took a fire drill made fire
and made a burnt offering to the gods
then i heard thunder
i thought it was a wave of the sea
trees were breaking the earth was trembling
when i uncovered my face
i found it was a serpent coming
he measured 30 cubits
his beard was bigger than 2 cubits
his skin was gilded
his eyebrows were of real lapis lazuli
he was bent up
he opened his mouth to me
while i was on my belly before him
he said to me
who brought you who brought you young man
who brought you
if you delay telling me who brought you to this island
i will make you know yourself to be ashes
turned into something that one cant see
you speak to me
but im not hearing it
i am before you and do not know myself
then he put me in his mouth
took me to the place where he lived
and set me down without harming me
i was uninjured without force applied to me
he opened his mouth to me
while i was on my belly before him
he then said to me
who brought you who brought you young man
who brought you to his island in the sea
with water on all sides
then i answered this to him
my arms bent before him
i said to him
its that i was going
to the mining region on a mission of the sovereign
in a boat 120 cubits long
and 40 cubits wide
with 120 sailors of the pick of egypt
whether they looked at the sky or looked at the land
they were more courageous than lions
they could foretell a gale before it came
and a thunderstorm before it happened
each one of them was more courageous and stronger
than his fellow
there was not a fool among them
a gale came up while we were at sea
before we had reached land
the wind rose and rose again
and a wave with it of 8 cubits
it was a beam that broke it for me
then the boat sank
and of those aboard none remained except myself
who is here with you
then i was brought to this island
by a wave of the sea
then he said to me
fear not fear not young man
do not turn pale
for you have reached me
look the god has let you live
and has brought you to this island of the spirit
there is nothing that is not on it
and it is full of all good things
you will spend month upon month
until you have completed four months on this island
then a boat will come from home
with sailors whom you know
and you will go home with them
and die in your city
how happy is he who can recount what he has experienced
when a painful thing has passed
i will recount to you something similar
which happened on this island
where i was with my relatives
including children
we were 75 serpents in all with my children and my relatives
i will not mention to you the youngest daughter
whom i had obtained by prayer
then a star fell
and they went up in flames because of it
it happened when i wasnt there
burnt when i wasnt among them
then i died for them
when i found them as one heap of corpses
if you are brave be stout hearted
and you will embrace your children
kiss your wife
and see your house
this is better than anything
you will reach home and remain there
among your relatives
i was stretched out on my belly
and touched the ground before him
i said to him
i shall recount your might to the sovereign
i shall make him aware of your greatness
i shall have them bring you ladanum malabathrum
terebinth balsam processed incense
with which every god is pleased
i shall recount what has happened to me
what i have seen of your might
one will thank the god for you
in the city before the council of the entire land
i shall slaughter bulls for you as burnt offering
and strangle fowl for you
i shall have boats brought for you
laden with all wealth of egypt
as done for a god who loves mankind
in a distant land that people do not know
then he laughed at me
at what i had said
which was wrong to his heart
he said to me
you dont have much myrrh
or any form of incense
but i am the ruler of punt
myrrh is mine
that malabathrum that you said would be brought
a large quantity is from this island
once it happens that you have left this place
you will never see this island again
which will have become water
then that boat came
as he had foretold previously
then i went
and put myself up a tall tree
and i recognized those who were aboard
then i went to report this
and found that he knew it
then he said to me
fare well fare well young man
to your house and see your children
let my name be good in your city
this is my due from you
then i placed myself on my belly
my arms bent before him
then he gave me a cargo
of myrrh malabathrum
terebinth balsam camphor
saasx plants black eye paint
giraffe tails
a great lump of incense
elephant tusks
hounds guenons apes
and all kinds of riches
then i loaded this onto the boat
and it happened that i placed myself on my belly
to thank the god for him
then he said to me
you will reach home within two months
you will embrace your children
you will become rejuvenated at home
and will be buried
then i went down to the shore near this boat
then i called to the expedition that was on this boat
i gave praise on the shore to the lord of this island
and those who were aboard did the same
then we sailed north
to the residence of the sovereign
and reached the residence within two months
like everything he had said
then i entered before the sovereign
and presented him with this tribute
that i had brought from within this island
then he thanked the god for me
before the council of the entire land
then i was appointed as follower
and was endowed with his people
see me having reached land
having viewed what i have experienced
listen to my speech
as it is good to listen to people
then he said to me
dont act clever friend
who would give water to a goose
when the day dawns of his slaughter in the morning
this was copied from start to finish
as found in writing
the writing of a scribe with skilled fingers
ameny son of amenyaa l.p.h.
royal seal keeper and sole companion
a servant of the royal thrones
who has passed to blessedness
the god entered into his horizon
was let to ascend to heaven
the residence l.p.h. was in silence
patricians were in the necropolis
without informing his army
who were following him in this army
and none of them was called
i placed myself between two bushes
to wait near the road where they were walking
since i didnt intend to become involved in contention
and i didnt think i would survive that one
this excellent god
and he saluted me but i feared him
by means of the west winds
i reached the walls of my father
i was thirsty and my throat was dry
and caught sight of bedouin
and what was done for me was good
and returned to kadesh
you will be happy here with me
then he said to me
it is sehotepibre who has gone to the horizon
it is unknown why this happened
but i was deceived
it was reported to me
my heart became tormented
although there was no reproach
i was like in a dreaming state
after he had spoken to me i answered him
and what he had ordered to be done was reported
he is one who bends down horns
he is stout hearted when he attacks the easterners
he is stout hearted when he attacks the easterners
when he has clasped his shield so that he may strike down
the slaying is not repeated
he will not evade the matter
men as well as women are cheering him
how joyful is the land that he rules
he will conquer southern lands
not considering the northern lands
you will be happy here with me
what will be done for you is good
he placed me at the head of his tribe
from the pick of what was his
it was without equal on earth
there was no limit to all kinds of its cattle
of the finest of his tribe
for me were prepared bread myt drink
and fish for me
many sweet things were prepared for me and milk was in every dish
i spent many years there
strong
a messenger who came north or went south to the residence
tarried for me
one was well disposed towards me in all respects
and i rescued those who were far away from the foreigners
let me carry out his many expeditions
as commander of his army
every land from which i returned
i had defeated
and took away all their food
with my bow with my arm
he placed me
at the head of his tribe
there came a strong man to retjenu
to issue a challenge in my tent
i said to him that he should fight with me
planning to seize my cattle
am i his companion
that i could come into this tent of his
have i opened his hurdle
because he sees me carrying out your affairs
there came a strong man of retjenu
and all hearts were sorry
thinking
on me
after i had evaded his weapons
i let arrows pass by him
i slew him with my axe
and put my backside on his chest
took me in his arms
and was kissing me in my clasp
my house was made wealthy before me
thus the god again became merciful
to one to whom destruction had been ordained .]
a man leaves his land because of nakedness
a man runs
and memory of me is in his palace
without me knowing it
i am truly despised
than your corpse being buried
in the land where you were born
happens that the god is my ally
to live throughout the land
if it is really him
may he hear the prayer from afar
for old age has come
my legs have ceased to walk
and i am near to passing away
then this matter was recounted
to the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt
kheperkare justified
son of re sesostris justified
according to this state that i was in
and gladdened the heart of this humble servant
the kings children who were following him
gold horus living of birth
sesostris justified
that this decree of the king is brought to you
to let you know that your roving through lands
having gone from qedi to retjenu
was under the guidance of your own heart
you have not cursed and nothing you said was reproved
one will not hear your name
because of speech that you fear will bring reproof
and you have not been negligent in the presence of officials
who opposed you concerning your utterances
but it was not in my heart against you
your heaven who is in my palace
endures and prospers as before
in the kingship of the land
and be pleased with their gifts
for you have begun to grow old
you have lost potency
you have thought of the day of burial
to you will be assigned a magical sheet
and wrappings from tayet
with a barque of gold
embellished with ebony
oxen dragging you
the dance of the poor will be performed
one will slaughter for you at the entrance of your tomb
your sarcophagus will be built of gold
as done for the kings children
and asiatics will not bury you
you will not be put in the wool of a ram
and your grave will not be made
all of this is important for someone who has roamed the earth
think of your corpse and return
after i had read it
and strewed it over my chest
how can this be done for this humble servant
whose own heart led him astray to an alien land
that saves me from death
copy of the reply to this decree written by
the servant of the palace sinuhe
concerning this flight
loved by ankh re
and praised by ankh re
lord of the horizon dwellers
by sobek re lord of the supports of heaven
gods lords of egypt
and atum and his great ennead
with bedouin locks
mistress of the palace
who is united with your head
the first divine council of the flood
min horus chief of the lands
and all the gods of the necropolis
and the islands in the middle of the sea
in all lands
who saves him from the west
o living god equal of re
who praises the heart of this humble servant to him himself
this humble servant seeks counsel from his god
this is placed before you
and you are strong
your towns and all the lands
are governed by your majesty l.p.h.
to let you be brought
meki of qadi
from the interior of araru
putting your guidance
in the lands of fenkhu
i am like your hounds
in his ignorance
it is not known what brought me to this land
one didnt run after me
but that fat of my body
my feet hastened
was i haughty before him
in dread of me throughout all foreign lands
whether i am at home or in this place
yours is what the sun revolves around
the sun rises for your sake
one lives on the breath that you give
and delicacies that you have allotted
this humble servant entrusts his chicks
begotten by him in this place
now that this humble servant has come southward
may his majesty l.p.h. do as he wishes
which all the gods desire to live forever
transferring his property to his children
all his serfs and cattle
i found
the commander in charge of the border patrol
that i was coming
to gladden the heart of this humble servant
like that of a ruler of any land
the kings children who were following his majesty l.p.h.
had me hear their messages
then this humble servant sailed southward
every servant was at his duty
until reaching the town of itji tawi
and the next day
ushering me
and i hurried
to the cabinet
i touched the ground with my forehead between the sphinxes
the officials ushered me while i hurried
and showed me the way to the cabinet
and bowed before him
but i was like a man in the dusk
i didnt know whether i was dead or alive
flight has taken its toll of you
you have grown old
it is no small matter that your corpse be buried
without your interment by foreigners
they will not make your grave
that you should fear your punishment
and the journey of my reaching the city of smiting the land
the kings children as many as they were
and his majesty l.p.h. said to the royal wife in khnemsut
is it really him
o sovereign l.p.h. our lord
now they had brought their menits and their sistra
with them
and presented them to his majesty l.p.h.
then they said to his majesty l.p.h.
ornament of the mistress of the two lands
may the golden one give you
life of your nostrils
and may the lord of the stars protect you
hail to you
slacken your bow
give us our beautiful gift
on this good day
one whom we name son of the north wind
born in egypt
the flight was made through terror of you
he turned away from this land through fear of you
a face will not scheme at the sight of your majesty l.p.h.
an eye that sees you does not fear
you will not fear
now i was standing by and heard his voice
and as he spoke i was close to a conspiracy
my heart fluttered my arms dropped and trembling befell every limb
i stole away leaping to find myself a hiding place
i placed myself between two bushes
to clear the road for its traveller
i then went south
i did not intend to come to this residence
since i expected there would be contention
that i didnt think i would survive
i crossed maati
in the vicinity of the sycamore
and i arrived on the island of snofru
i spent the day at the edge of a field
and departed early the next day
i met a man standing on the road
and he saluted me one who feared him
after it had become dinner time
i reached the port of negau
i crossed in a boat without a rudder
by means of the west wind
i passed east of the quarry above the mistress of the red mountain
then i made my way northward
i reached the walls of the ruler
made to restrain the bedouin
i crouched down in a bush
for fear of being seen by
the guards in the settlement who were on duty
i travelled during the night
and the next morning i reached peten
i halted on an island of kemur
an attack of thirst overtook me
i was parched and my throat was dry
i thought this is the taste of death
i lifted my heart and collected myself
when i heard the sound of bellowing of cattle
and caught sight of bedouin
their leader who had been in egypt recognized me
he gave me water and boiled milk for me
i went with him to his tribe
and what they did was good
land gave me to land
i departed from byblos
and returned to qedem
i had spent a year and a half there
when amunenshi fetched me
who was ruler of upper retjenu
he said to me
you will be happy with me
for youll hear the language of egypt
he said this because he knew my character
and had heard of my experience
for the egyptians who were there with him had borne witness to me
then he said to me
why is it that you have come here
has anything happened in the residence
the king of upper and lower egypt
sehotepibre has gone to the horizon
the circumstances of it are unknown
but i fabricated
when i had returned from an expedition to the land of the libyans
it was reported to me
my mind became weak
and my heart was not in my body
it brought me to the ways of flight
although i was not talked about
my face was not spat on
a reproach was not heard
and my name was not heard from the mouth of a herald
i do not know what brought me to this land
it is like a plan of god
how will that land be without him
that excellent god
fear of whom was throughout the lands
like of sekhmet in a year of pestilence
i said to him answering him
his son has already entered the palace
and has assumed the inheritance of his father
now he is a god without equal
there is no other before him
he is possessor of wisdom
excellent of plans effective of orders
coming and going are by his command
it was he who subjugated the foreign lands
while his father was within his palace
and he reported what he had ordered to be done
now he is a hero who acts with his own arm
a champion without equal
when he is seen attacking barbarians
and approaching combat
he is one who bends down horns
and weakens hands
so that his enemy cannot marshal troops
he is vengeful one who smashes heads
one cannot stand near him
he is far striding when he annihilates the fugitive
there is no good end for him who shows him his back
he is steadfast at the moment of forcing retreat
he is one who disables without showing his back
he is stout hearted when he sees multitudes
he doesnt let laziness near his heart
he is eager when he sees the east
his joy is his attacking barbarians
as he clasps his shield he strikes down
he doesnt repeat the slaying
as there is no one who escapes his arrow
and no one who draws his bow
the barbarians flee from his arms
as from the might of the great one
he fights having foreseen the outcome
heedless of all else
he is beloved great of charm
he has conquered through love
his city loves him more than itself
it rejoices over him more than over its god
men and women pass by cheering him
he is a king who conquered in the egg
he was dedicated since he was born
he is one who makes those born with him plentiful
he is the unique gift of god
how joyful is this land that he rules
he is one who extends borders
he will conquer southern lands
not considering the northern lands
as he was made to smite the asiatics and trample the bedouin
go down to him and let him know your name
as someone far from his majesty who inquires
he will not fail to do good to a foreign land
that will be loyal to him
then he said to me
but then egypt is happy since it knows his ability
you are here and you will stay with me
what i shall do for you is good
he placed me at the head of his children
and he married me to his eldest daughter
he let me choose for myself of his land
from the pick of what was his
on his border with another land
it was a good land called araru
figs were in it and grapes
it had more wine than water
its honey was plentiful and its moringa oil was abundant
every kind of fruit was on its trees
barley was there and emmer
there was no limit to all kinds of cattle
much came to me because of the love of me
he made me the ruler of a tribe
of the finest of his land
provisions were made for me consisting of daily fare
a daily supply of wine
cooked meat roast fowl as well as desert game
one would snare for me
and lay it out for me
in addition to the catch of my hounds
they made for me
i spent many years
while my children became strong
each man controlling his tribe
a messenger who came north or went south to the residence
tarried for me
i let everyone tarry
i gave water to the thirsty
i showed the way to the stray
and i rescued the robbed
the bedouin who were preparing to fight and to oppose the rulers of the lands
i countered their movements
this ruler of retjenu
let me spend many years
as commander of his army
every land against which i advanced
i defeated
it being driven from its pastures and wells
i seized its cattle
i carried off its inhabitants
and took away their food
i slew its people
with my arm with my bow
with my movements
and with my excellent plans
in his heart i was beneficial
and he loved me for he knew that i was valiant
he placed me
at the head of his children
for he had seen my arms were proficient
there came a strong man of retjenu
to challenge me in my tent
he was a hero without equal
and he had entirely annihilated it
he said he would fight with me
he intended to rob me
planning to seize my cattle
on the advice of his tribe
that ruler conferred with me
i said i do not know him
i am not his companion
that i could walk freely in his camp
is it the case that i have opened his hurdle
or climbed over his walls
it is resentment
because he sees me carrying out his affairs
i have become like a bull of cattle in the midst of other cows
whom the bull of the herd attacks
whom the longhorn is charging
is an insignificant man loved as a superior
there is no barbarian who associates with a marsh dweller
what can papyrus achieve on a mountain
does a bull want to fight
or does the fighting bull want to sound the retreat for fear of being equalled
if it is his wish to fight
let him express his desire
is a god ignorant of what he has ordained
or does he know what the situation is
at night i strung my bow shot my arrows
sharpened my dagger
and polished my weapons
when the day dawned retjenu had come
it had assembled its tribes
and had gathered its neighbouring lands
planning this battle
every heart burned for me
wives were jabbering
and every heart was sorry for me
thinking
is there another hero who could fight him
then his shield his axe
and an armful of his spears came down
after i had made his weapons miss
i let his arrows pass by me
to no effect
one close to the other
when he approached me
i shot him
and my arrow was stuck in his neck
he cried out and fell on his face
i slew him with his axe
and uttered my war cry on his back
while every asiatic was shouting
i gave praise to month
whose supporters celebrated a triumph through him
this ruler amunenshi
took me in his arms
then i carried off his property
and seized his cattle
what he had planned to do to me
i did to him
i took what was in his tent
and despoiled his encampment
with this i became great
grew wealthy in goods
and grew rich in cattle
thus the god acted to be merciful
to one with whom he had been angry
one whom he had led astray to another land
today his heart is glad
a fugitive flees because of his environment
while my fame is in the residence
a creeping man creeps because of hunger
while i give bread to my neighbour
a man leaves his land because of nakedness
while i have white and fine linen
a man runs because of the lack of someone to send
while i have many servants
my house is fine my grounds are extensive
and memory of me is in the palace
all the gods who ordained this flight
may you be merciful and bring me home
perhaps you will let me to see the place where my heart dwells
what matters more than my corpse being buried
in the land where i was born
this is a call for help
that a good event may occur
that the god may give me grace
may he act as to make well the end of one whom he had grieved
as his heart feels pity for one whom he had compelled
to live in a foreign land
is it today that he is so gracious
as to hear the prayer from afar
and as to exchange the region where he had roamed the earth
for the place from which he had brought him away
may the king of egypt be merciful to me
that i may live by his mercy
may i greet the mistress of the land who is in his palace
may i hear the messages of her children
then my body will become young again
for old age has come
weakness has overtaken me
my eyes are heavy
my arms are weak
my legs have ceased to follow
the heart is weary
and i am near to passing away
may they lead me to the cities of eternity
may i follow the mistress of all
then she will tell me that her children are well
may she pass eternity above me
now the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt kheperkare justified was told
about this state in which i was
and his majesty sent a message to me
with royal gifts
to gladden the heart of this humble servant
like that of a ruler of any land
the kings children who were in his palace
had me hear their messages
copy of the decree brought to this humble servant
concerning his being brought back to egypt
horus living of birth
two ladies living of birth
the king of upper and lower egypt kheperkare
son of re
amenemhet may he live forever until eternity
royal decree to follower sinuhe
this decree of the king is brought to you
to let you know that your roving through lands
having gone from qedem to retjenu
land giving you to land
was at the counsel of your heart to you
what have you done that one should act against you
you have not cursed that one should reprove your speech
and you have not spoken in the council of officials
that one should oppose your utterances
this idea carried away your heart
but it was not in the heart against you
this heaven of yours who is in the palace
endures and prospers to this day
her head is covered with the kingship of the land
and her children are in the cabinet
you will accumulate precious things that they will give to you
and live on their gifts
return to egypt
and you will see the residence where you grew up
you will kiss the ground at the great double gate
and you will join the companions
for now you have begun to grow old
you have lost virility
think of the day of burial
and passing to blessedness
to you will be assigned a night with oils
and wrappings from the hands of tayet
a funeral procession will be held for you
on the day of burial
with a mummy sheath of gold
and a mask of lapis lazuli
heaven above you
you having been placed in a hearse
oxen dragging you
musicians preceding you
the dance of the inert ones will be performed
at the entrance of your tomb
the requisites for a mortuary offering will be recited for you
one will slaughter at the entrance of your altar
your pillars will be built of limestone
in the midst of those of the kings children
you will never die in a foreign land
and asiatics will not bury you
you will not be put in the skin of a ram
when your grave is made
it has been a long time of roaming the earth
mind the dead body and return
this decree reached me
as i was standing in the middle of my tribe
when it had been read to me
i placed myself on my belly
i touched the earth
and strewed it over my chest
i went around my encampment cheering saying
how can this be done for a servant
whose heart led him astray to alien lands
so good is the kindness
that saves me from death
your spirit will let me reach the end
with my body at home
copy of the reply to this decree
servant of the palace sinuhe says
in very good peace
concerning this flight
that this humble servant made in his ignorance
it is your spirit good god lord of the two lands
loved by re
and praised by month lord of thebes
by amun lord of the throne of the two lands
by sobek re
horus hathor
and atum with his ennead
by sopdu neferbau semseru the eastern horus
by nebet imhet
may she enfold your head
the divine council upon the flood
min horus in the midst of the lands
wereret mistress of punt nut
harwerre
and all the gods of egypt
and the islands of the sea
may they give life and dominion to your nostrils
endow you with their gifts
and give you eternity without limit
forever without end
and may fear of you resound
in flat lands and mountainous lands
for you have subjugated what the sun revolves around
this is the prayer of this humble servant to his lord
who saves from the west
lord of perception perceiver of the people who perceives
as the majesty of the palace
what this humble servant was afraid to say
it is like something too great to recount
o great god equal of re
in understanding one who serves him
this humble servant is in the hands of one who cares for him
placed under his guidance
your majesty is conquering horus
your arms are stronger than all lands
now may your majesty command that he be made to bring
meki from qedem
khentiuash from the interior of keshu
and minos
from the two lands of fenkhu
they are rulers whose names are well known
who live by love of you
without mentioning retjenu
it is yours like your hounds
this flight that the servant made
it was not intended
it was not in my heart
i did not devise it
i dont know what separated me from the place
it was as a dreaming state
as if a marsh dweller saw himself in elephantine
a man from the delta in taseti
there was no fear
one didnt run after me
i didnt hear a reproach
and my name was not heard from the mouth of a herald
but that shuddering of my body
my feet hastened
my heart drove me
the god who ordained this flight
dragged me away
i was not haughty before
as a man respects one whom his land knows
re has put the fear of you throughout the land
and the dread of you in every foreign land
whether i am at home or in this place
yours is what this horizon veils
the sun rises for your sake
the water of the river is drunk when you wish
and the air of heaven is breathed when you say so
this humble servant will entrust his chicks
begotten by this humble servant in this place
now that one has come to this humble servant
may your majesty do as he wishes
one lives on the breath that you give
may re horus and hathor love
this noble nose of yours
which month lord of thebes desires to live forever
i was allowed to spend a day in araru
transferring my property to my children
my eldest son was in charge of my tribe
my tribe and all my property were in his hands
all my serfs and my cattle
my fruit and each fruit tree of mine
then this humble servant came southward
i halted at the road of horus
the commander there in charge of the border patrol
sent a message to the residence to let them know
then his majesty let
the excellent overseer of the peasants of the palace come
accompanied by laden ships
bearing royal gifts
for the bedouin who had come with me
leading me to the road of horus
i mentioned each one of them by his name
every servant was at his duty
and when i set sail
there was kneading and straining beside me
until i reached the town of usu
and very early the next morning
they came to call me
ten men came and ten men went
ushering me
to the palace
i touched the ground with my forehead between the sphinxes
as the kings children stood in the gateway to meet me
the companions who ushered to the audience hall
showed me the way to the cabinet
i found his majesty on the great throne in the gateway of electrum
i was stretched out on my belly
and did not know myself before him
this god addressed me kindly
but i was like a man seized in the dusk
my soul fainted
my limbs failed
my heart was not in my body
that i could distinguish life from death
then his majesty said to one of these companions
raise him up
and let him speak to me
and his majesty said
you have returned
after roaming foreign lands
flight has taken its toll of you
old man
you have reached old age
it is no small matter that your corpse be buried
without your interment by barbarians
do not act against yourself do not act against yourself anymore
you did not speak when your name was pronounced
you shouldnt be afraid of punishment
i answered this with the answer of a frightened man
what has my lord said to me
if i answer it
it is not because of me
but it is the act of a god
it is that there is fright in my body
like that which caused the fated flight
i am before you
life is yours
may your majesty do as he wishes
then the kings children were ushered in
and his majesty said to the royal wife
sinuhe has returned as an asiatic
raised by bedouin
then she uttered a very great cry
and the kings children shrieked as one
then they said to his majesty
is it not really him
sovereign my lord
and his majesty said
it is really him
now they had brought their menits their sistra
and their naos sistra
with them
and they presented them to his majesty
your hands upon something good
enduring king
ornament of the mistress of heaven
may the golden one give
life to your nostrils
and may the mistress of the stars enfold you
the crown of upper egypt travels north
and the crown of lower egypt travels south
joined and united by the word of your majesty
while the cobra is placed on your forehead
you have delivered the poor from evil
so may re lord of the two lands be gracious to you
hail to you as to the mistress of all
slacken your bow
and lay down your arrow
give breath to him who is suffocating
give us our beautiful gift
this one who is named son of the north wind
the barbarian born in egypt
he took flight through fear of you
he left the land through terror of you
a face will not pale at the sight of your face
an eye that gazes at you will not fear
and his majesty said
he will not fear
he will not gibber with terror
he will be a companion among the officials
and he will be included in the entourage
proceed to the robing room to wait on him
then i came out of the cabinet
while the kings children were giving me their hands
afterwards we went to the great double gate
i was assigned to the house of a kings son
in which there were precious things
a bathroom divine images of the horizon
valuables from the treasury
clothes of royal linen myrrh
and fine oil of the king
officials whom he loved were in every room
and every servant was at his duty
years were made to vanish from my body
i was clothed and my hair was combed
a reward was given to the foreign land
and clothes to the bedouin
i was clothed in fine linen
was anointed with fine oils
and slept on a bed
i returned the sand to those who are upon it
and the wood oil to those who are smeared with it
for me my house and my garden were given back to the owner
which had been in the hands of a companion
many craftsmen rebuilt it
and all of its trees were planted anew
meals were brought to me
from the palace three or four times a day
in addition to what the kings children gave
without a moment of interruption
a pyramid of stone was built for me
in the midst of the pyramids
the overseer of the masons of the pyramid
took charge of its ground plan
the overseer of the seal makers painted
the sculptors carved
and the overseer of workers in the necropolis
concerned himself with it
all required equipment to be put in a tomb shaft was supplied therein
mortuary priests were given to me
and a tomb garden was made for me
with fields in front in the right place
as done for a chief companion
my image was overlaid with gold
its kilt with electrum
it is his majesty who let this be done
there is no commoner for whom the like has been done
i was in the favour of the king
until the day of death came
this was copied from start to finish as found in writing
i was stretched out on my belly
my limbs failed
a numerous army to the libyan land
my pyramid of stone was built
in the vicinity of the pyramid
of the stonemasons
the masons of the pyramid
divided its ground plan
painters painted in it
the overseer of the sculptors carved in it
and the overseer of works at the necropolis
concerned himself with it
with delightful fields in the right place
prince regent and count
magistrate and commissioner of the domains
of the sovereign in the lands of the bedouin
true and beloved acquaintance of the king follower sinuhe says
i was a follower who followed his lord
a servant of the royal harem
and of the regentess greatly praised
royal wife of sesostris in khnemsut
royal daughter of amenemhet
in qanefru nefru
revered
year 30 month 3 of the season of inundation day 7
the god departed to his horizon
the king of upper and lower egypt sehotepibre
ascended to heaven and united with the sun
the divine body merging with him who created him
the residence was in silence
hearts were in mourning
the great double gate was shut
courtiers were grieving
patricians were wailing
now his majesty had sent
an army to the libyan land
with his eldest son in command
the good god sesostris
had been sent to smite the foreign lands
to slay the inhabitants of libya
and was now returning having carried off captives from libya
and countless of all kinds of cattle
the companions of the palace sent a message
to the western border
to inform the kings son of the affair that had happened in the cabinet
the messengers found him on the road
reaching him at nightfall
he never hesitated at all
and the falcon flew off with his followers
without informing his army of it
now a message had been sent to the kings children
who were following him in this army
and one of them was called
until the road and its traveller were separated
and trample the bedouin
the guard on the wall who was on duty
i lifted my heart and my body
when i heard the bellowing of cattle
why have you come here
then i said to him
although i was not spat on
i was not talked about in my presence
as if a marsh dweller saw himself in elephantine
a man from the delta in taseti
then he said to me
and he reported to him what he ordered to be done
he is far striding when he shoots the fugitive
he is eager when he attacks the easterners
the barbarians flee before him
his mind was set to it since he was born
send a message to him
because he sees me carrying out your affairs
another herd
then he came at me while i waited
having positioned myself near him
he intended to smite me
and exchange the region where i had roamed the earth
for the place from which he had brought him away
o living who are on earth
consisting of
prophets and prophetesses

and male and female musicians

i was a young man before i had married

then i brought booty from there
two living men and three hands
i was rewarded with gold once more
and two female slaves were given to me
his majesty sailed northward
rejoicing in strength and victory
having captured southerners and northerners
then aata came to the south
and his fate brought on his doom
when the gods of upper egypt grasped him
he was found by his majesty at tent ta o
and his majesty brought him away as captive
and all his people as booty
then i brought two warriors as captives from the ship of aata
i was given five people
and five arourae of land in my town

then i was appointed to be naval commander
and his majesty became as enraged as a panther
his majesty shot
and his first arrow stuck in the chest of that enemy
it was done there in an act of massacre
and their people were brought away as captives
his majesty sailed northward
all foreign lands in his grasp
that wretched nubian nomad hung with his head downward
from the prow of the falcon ship of his majesty
one landed at karnak
thereafter one proceeded to retjenu
to vent his fury throughout the lands
when his majesty reached naharina
his majesty l.p.h. found that enemy marshalling troops
and his majesty carried out a large massacre among them

and she said to me
this fish pendant of new turquoise has fallen into the water
then i said to her

and she said to me i prefer my own thing to its substitute
then the chief lector priest djadjaemankh said his magic spell
and put one side of the water of the lake on top of the other
and found the fish pendant lying on a shard
he then fetched it and gave it to its owner
now as for the water it was twelve cubits in its middle
and it ended up being twenty four cubits after its folding up
then he said his magic spell
and returned the parts of water of the lake to their positions

then prince hordedef stood up to speak and said
one cannot distinguish truth from falsehood
and his majesty said what is this hordedef my son
prince hordedef said

who lives in djed snofru
he is a commoner a hundred and ten years old
who eats five hundred loaves of bread a shoulder of beef for meat
and drinks a hundred jars of beer up to this day
he knows how to mend a severed head

now the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt cheops justified spent the day
seeking for himself these chambers of the sanctuary of thoth
in order to make something similar for himself for his horizon
his majesty said
you yourself hordedef my son will bring him to me
then boats were prepared for prince hordedef
and he went southward to djed snofru
after the boats had been moored to the river bank
he travelled overland
seated in a palanquin of ebony
with poles of ssndm wood
plated with gold
when he had reached djedi
the palanquin was set down
then he stood up to greet him
while a servant at his head was anointing him
and another was rubbing his feet
then prince hordedef said
your condition is like that of one who lives before the infirmity of old age
although old age means dying laying to rest and burial
and who sleeps till dawn free from illness
without an old age of coughing
greeting o blessed one
i have come here to summon you by order
of my father cheops justified
you will eat delicacies provided by the king
the foods of his companions

and may your soul know the roads that lead to the portal of him who shelters the dead
greeting o prince
then prince hordedef held out his arms to him
and raised him up
then he proceeded with him to the river bank
giving him his arm
djedi then said
let me be given one of the barges
so that it may bring me the children and my books
then two boats were made available to him together with their crew
and djedi came northward
in the barge in which prince hordedef was
after he had reached the residence
prince hordedef entered
to report to the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt cheops justified
and prince hordedef said

then his majesty said

and let his sentence be executed
whereupon djedi said
but not to a human sovereign l.p.h. my lord
look doing something like that to the noble flock is not ordained
then a goose was brought to him and its head was cut off
the goose was placed at the west side of the audience hall
and its head at the east side of the audience hall
then djedi said his magic spell
and the goose stood up waddling
its head likewise
after one had reached the other
the goose stood up cackling
then he had a xt aa goose brought to him
and the same was done to it
then his majesty had a bull brought to him
and its head was felled to the ground
then djedi said his magic spell
and the bull stood up behind him
its leash having fallen on the ground
then king cheops justified said

and djedi said

but i know the place where it is kept
then his majesty said

well it is in that casket
then his majesty said go and bring it to me
and djedi said

then his majesty said

and djedi said

who is pregnant with three children of re lord of sakhbu
he has said about it

the eldest of them will be high priest in heliopolis
and his majesty fell into a bad mood at this
then djedi said

was it caused by the three children that i mentioned
first your son then his son then one of them
then his majesty said

then his majesty said

then the majesty of re lord of sakhbu said
to isis nephthys meskhenet heqet and khnum
o may you go
and deliver ruddjedet of the three children who are in her womb
who will perform this magisterial office in this entire land
for they will build your temples
provision your altars

and increase your divine offerings
then these gods proceeded
after they had changed their appearance into that of musicians
and khnum was with them carrying luggage
then they arrived at the house of reusre
and found him standing with his kilt upside down
then they presented him with their menits and sistra
he then said to them
my ladies look there is a woman who is suffering
for her labour is difficult
then they said
let us see her
for we are knowledgeable about childbirth
and he said to them come in
then they entered towards ruddjedet
and they locked the room with her and them in it
then isis placed herself before her
nephthys behind her and heqet was hastening the birth
then isis said
may you not be powerful in her womb in this name of yours of userref
and this child rushed into her arms a baby of one cubit
his bones were strong his limbs were destined to be of gold
and his scalp of real lapis lazuli
and they washed him after his umbilical cord had been cut
and he was placed on a couch of brick
then meskhenet approach him
and said

then meskhenet approach him
and said

and khnum made his limbs healthy
and they washed him after his umbilical cord had been cut

these gods then went out
having delivered ruddjedet of the three children
and they said
rejoice reusre
for three children have been born to you
then he said to them
my ladies what can i do for you
please give this barley to your bearer
and accept it as a tip
then khnum loaded himself with the barley
and they proceeded to where they had come from
then isis said to these gods
what is it that we have come for
if not to perform a wonder for these children
that we may report to their father who let us come
then they created three lordly crowns l.p.h.
and they put them in the barley
then they made the sky turn into storm and rain
and they returned to the house
they said
please put the barley here in a sealed room
until we return from making music in the north
and they put the barley in a sealed room
then ruddjedet became pure in a purification of fourteen days
then she said to her maid

and she said
it has been prepared with every good thing
except for the jars
they havent been brought
then ruddjedet said
but why havent the jars been brought
and the maid said
there is nothing for contents here
except for the barley of these musicians
which is in a room under their seal
then ruddjedet said

and reusre will give them compensation for it after he returns
and the maid went and opened the room
then she heard the noise of singing music making dancing cheering
and everything that is done for a king in the room
then she went
and recounted everything she had heard to ruddjedet
then she went through the room
but couldnt find the place where it was done
then she put her ear to the sack
and found it was being done in it
then she put it in a box
which was put in another chest
bound with leather
she put it in a room containing her belongings
and locked it up
then reusre returned coming from the land
and ruddjedet recounted this matter to him
and he was exceedingly happy
then they sat down for a day of celebration
now when some days had passed after this
ruddjedet had a quarrel with the maid
and had her punished with a beating
then the maid said to the people in the household

she has given birth to three kings
ill go and tell this
to the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt cheops
justified
and she went
and found her eldest uncle on her mothers side
binding flax and yarn on the terrace
and he said to her
where are you making off to little girl
and she recounted this matter to him
then her uncle said to her
and what is to be done is what you do coming to me
and i should join in the betrayal
then he took a bundle of flax to her
and administered her a nasty blow
then the maid went to get a cup of water for herself
and a crocodile snatched her
her uncle then went to tell this to ruddjedet
and he found ruddjedet sitting in grief
her mood was exceedingly bad
then he said to her
my lady why are you in this mood
and she said

then he bent his head down
and said
she might go with me
then i administered her a nasty blow
then she went to draw some water for herself
and a crocodile snatched her
i am one who says what is good and repeats what is loved
his majesty appointed me scribe of the cadaster and his majesty showed me great favour
and how egypt sails depends on what you command
although it is found with slave-girls at the mill-stones
behold i am before thee
i placed myself on my belly
overseer of the house
possessor of veneration venerable
the king of egypt
the great ones of abydus
i will take away thy ass peasant because it is eating my corn
i set out early when it was day
such is osiris
after thy own old age
there is no tomb for him-who-rebels against his majesty
it was of 30 cubits
to thee belongs gold
behold thou art a city without a ruler
this is an instruction
lo his majesty was himself in the eastern fortress
there is no misstatement therein
there is indeed no boasting therein
thou shalt have thy former heart
it seemed to him like heaven
thou art the father of the orphan
the name of her mother is tjuia
this is the road of thoth to the house of maet
what is pray the thing which thou hast done to it
who is he
it is i who am the ruler of pwenet
he was a peasant of the wady natrun
a mans goodness is his monument
lo he was a beneficent son
i am not forsooth a confederate of his
greater was my praise in the palace than that of any unique friend
how like to her it is!
i will cause him to become acquainted with thy greatness
the incense it belongs to me
behold god has caused thee to live
as to anyone who does not know this spell he shall never enter
as to all which is in writing on the papyrus-roll hear it
if thou harkenest to this that i have said to thee every plan of thine will go forward
if thou art well-to-do thou shalt found thy house
the priests who-are-in their times
every one thereof
my favours from the king
within two months
in two months
by him in whose body the pains are
like one who has not been ill
if the face of this fall to the ground nut will fall to the ground
thereupon this official placed the command before me as follows
who is it that has brought thee
wealth does not indeed come of itself
i speak i cause you to hear
as for a temple day it is the three hundred and sixtieth part of the year
in the favour of sokar!
finding him by his majesty
he placed me in front of his children
mayst thou go out and in without being driven back and without being turned away from the door of the netherworld
whose name is not known
beware of eating the adu-fish
welcome to me
cause my name to be fair in thy city
their wine was found lying in their presses
a chariot wrought in gold
lo i was standing and i heard or as i was standing i heard
thou shalt cause provisions to be given to him
now while i was stretched on my belly
i found it was a serpent which was coming
the heart of thy majesty will be refreshed at seeing
a ship will come from home
behold i will take away thy ass peasant
haste thee
tarry thou
do not be puffed up on account of thy knowledge
let us not go upon that difficult road
let not men see
thou shalt do nothing concerning it
he will not fail to do good to the land which will be loyal to him
it is more useful for him who does it than him for whom it is done
o ye who love life and hate death
every son of mine who shall strengthen this boundary
behold it is the supporting of the chief which is done by thee
but as to everyone over whom it is read every day
his son who is beloved of him
praised of hathor
one to whom judges listen
all that he gave to me
i did what men love and what the gods praise or i did what is loved of men and what is praised of the gods
of which my lord l p h said i will cause it to be made for thee
thou wilt not find anything whereon thou mayst rest
the making of all changes into which he may wish to change
these things which i have given to these priests
sailors being in it whom thou knowest
there is nothing at all which he does not know
he who was formerly a messenger now sends another
now as for him who shall lose it and shall not fight on behalf of it
provide not for to-morrow before it has come
they could foretell a storm before it came and a tempest before it happened
i came into existence when bulls had not yet been born and cows had not yet been made
how hast thou come to this pass
i have come to you in order that i may break your water-pots
behold i have written commending thee to the steward
as for him who sails with falsehood for a cargo he does not reach land
behold three children have been born to thee
now these fields had been made into plough-lands
it is to be mixed together
i made for myself this tomb it being consecrated and its place being embellished at the staircase of the great god
his head is not or has not been taken away from him
then the choice joints shall be removed from the altars of the gods
says he namely atum
the land sails in accordance with thy commmand
i used to sail down with its tribute to the king every year and went forth thence vindicated and no deficiency was found in me
may thy majesty do as he wills
i spent 110 years of life which the king gave to me
whenever heaven rages
as when water flows
she will give birth on the fifteenth day of the first month of winter
may the inundation god bring him his offering may he eat with his mouth may he see with his eyes
then let us make a habitation together
o that thou mayst act according as i say
i have never seen the like of this goose
no one had run after me
i do not know who brought me to this country
but it is found with handmaidens at their mill-stones
thereupon his majesty kept sending to me with presents
then i reached the red sea
then he laughed at me
never had it been done since the time of king snofru the justified
they were more beautiful than that which had existed formerly
is the saying true
it that-of-thirty cubits

And do not let Unas see you!
"Unas is Horus, who came forth from the acacia, who came forth from the acacia ."
