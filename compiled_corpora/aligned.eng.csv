"<2> Year 22, second month of the Season of Growing, day 10."
A summary of the deeds of valour and strength
"that this good god performed,"
consisting of every excelling deed of bravery since the beginning
"of the first generation,"
"which the lord of the gods, the lord of Armant, did for him,"
magnifying his victories to let <3> his valour be related
"for millions of years to come,"
next to the deeds of bravery
that His Majesty did continuously.
"If one were to recount a deed by its name,"
they would be too numerous to put into writing.
"When he shoots at a copper target,"
all wood is splintered like a papyrus reed.
"His Majesty offered an example thereof in the temple of Amun,"
with a target of hammered copper
of three digits in thickness;
"when he had shot his arrow there,"
"he caused protrusion of three palms <5> behind it,"
so as to cause the followers to pray for the proficiency of his arms
in valour and strength.
"I'm telling you what he did,"
"without deception and without lie,"
"in front of his entire army,"
and there is no word of exaggeration therein.
"When he spent <6> a moment of recreation,"
"hunting in any foreign land,"
the quantity that he captured was greater
than what the entire army achieved.
He slew seven lions by shooting in an instant.
He captured <7> a herd of twelve wild bulls
"in an hour at the time of breakfast,"
their tails behind him.
He killed 120 elephants in the foreign country of Niya
when he came from Naharina.
"<8> He crossed the river Euphrates,"
"and trampled the towns on its banks,"
which were destroyed by fire forever.
"He captured a rhinoceros by shooting in the southern land <9> of
Taseti,"
after he had gone to Miu
to seek out him who had rebelled against him in that land.
He erected his stela there
His Majesty didn't halt
while proceeding to the land of <10> Djahi
"to slay the rebels who were there,"
and to give goods to those who were loyal to him.
"His Majesty returned every <11> time,"
"his attack having succeeded with valour and strength,"
while he let Egypt be in its state
as the first victory.
It was His Majesty who opened its road
and who explored its every way
His Majesty entered upon that road
"<13> that was very narrow,"
"at the head of his entire army,"
"while all foreign lands were assembled,"
<14> The enemy failed
"and fled quickly to their town,"
"His Majesty came in joy,"
"<""c""> He of Edfu, great god, lord of heaven."
<r1> Khons-in-Thebes-Neferhotep.
"<r2> The king of Upper and Lower Egypt, lord of the Two Lands:"
Usermare-sotpenre;
"<r3> Son of Re, of his body:"
"Ramesse beloved of Amun,"
"<r4> given life like Re, eternally."
<r5> All protection for life with him.
"<r6> Burning incense for his father, Khons-in-Thebes."
<l1> The name of the prophet and priest
<l2> of Khons-the-Provider-in-<l3>Thebes:
Khons-hat-netjer-neb.
"<l4> Khons-the-Provider-in-<l5>Thebes,"
"<l6> the great god who expels disease demons,"
<l7> beloved and given life like Re.
"<1> Horus: Mighty bull, perfect of appearance;"
(Two Ladies:) Abiding in kingship like Atum;
"Gold Horus: Powerful of arms, who drives away the Nine Bows;"
"The king of Upper and Lower Egypt, lord of the Two Lands:"

"Son of Re, of his body:"
"Ramesse beloved of Amun,"
"Amun-Re, lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands"
"and of the Ennead, mistresses of Thebes."
"Good god, son of Amun, offspring of Re-Harakhti,"
"glorious seed of the Almighty,"
"begotten by Kamutef,"
"king of the Black Land, ruler of the Red Land,"
"sovereign <3> who seized the Nine Bows,"
"whom victory was foretold as he came from the womb,"
"whom valor was given while he was in the egg,"
"bull stout-hearted as he enters the arena,"
divine king going forth on the day of victory like Month
one great of strength <4> like the son of Nut!
"When His Majesty was in Naharina according to his annual custom,"
the princes of every foreign land came bowing in peace
"to the might of His Majesty, from as far as the marshlands."
"Their gifts of gold, silver, lapis lazuli,"
"<5> turquoise and every kind of herb from the God's Land were on their
backs,"
and each one was outdoing his fellow.
Then the prince of Bakhtan had his gifts sent
"and placed his eldest daughter before them, praising His Majesty,"
and imploring life from him.
"The woman pleased the heart of His Majesty very much, more than
anything,"
and her titulary was established as Great Royal Wife Nefrure.
"When His Majesty arrived back in Egypt,"
she did everything that a queen should do.
"It happened in year 15, second month of the Season of Harvest, day 22,"
"while His Majesty was in Thebes-the-victorious, mistress of cities,"
"performing <7> the rites for his father Amun-Re,"
"lord of the throne of the Two Lands, at his beautiful feast of Luxor,"
"his favourite place since the beginning,"
that one came to say to His Majesty:
'There is a messenger of the prince of Bakhtan
who has come with many gifts for the queen.'
Then he was brought <8> before His Majesty with his gifts
"and he said, saluting His Majesty:"
"'Hail to you, Re of the Nine Bows!"
Give us life from you!'
"Then he payed tribute to His Majesty,"
and he went on to say to His Majesty:
"'I have come to you, sovereign, lord,"
"on account of Bentresh,"
the younger sister of queen Nefrure.
An illness has seized her body.
May Your Majesty send a learned man to see her.'
And His Majesty said:
'Bring me personnel of the academy
and the council <10> of the residence.'
And they were ushered in to him immediately.
Then His Majesty said:
"'Look, you have been summoned to hear this matter."
"Now, bring me a learned man"
and excellent scribe from among you.'
"Then the royal scribe Thothemheb came before His Majesty,"
and His Majesty ordered him to go to Bakhtan with this messenger.
The learned man then arrived in Bakhtan
and found Bentresh possessed by a spirit;
he found <12> him an enemy whom one could fight.
"Then the prince of Bakhtan went on to report to His Majesty, saying:"
"day 4, during the feast of Amun,"
while His Majesty was in Thebes.
"His Majesty then reported to Khons-in-Thebes-Neferhotep, saying:"
"'Good lord, I report to you concerning the daughter of the prince of
Bakhtan.'"
"Then Khons-in-Thebes-Neferhotep proceeded to Khons-the-Provider,"
the great god who expels disease demons.
Then His Majesty said to Khons-in-Thebes-Neferhotep:
"'Good lord, will you turn your face to Khons-<15>the-Provider,"
"the great god who expels disease demons,"
making him go to Bakhtan?'
A very strongly approving nod.
Then His Majesty said:
"'Give your magical protection to him,"
"and I will let His Majesty go to Bakhtan to save the daughter of the
prince of Bakhtan.'"
<16> A very strongly approving nod of the head
from Khons-in-Thebes-Neferhotep.
Then he created magical protection for Khons-the-Provider-in-Thebes
four times.
"His Majesty ordered that Khons-the-Provider-in-Thebes be made to
proceed"
"to the great barque, (with) five boats, a chariot <17> and many horses
on the right and left."
"This god arrived in Bakhtan at the end of one year and five months,"
and the prince of Bakhtan came with his army and his officials
before Khons-the-Provider.
"He placed himself <18> on his belly, saying:"
"'You have come to us to be merciful to us,"
as the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Usermare-sotpenre has commanded!'
"This god then went to the place where Bentresh was,"
"and created magical protection for the daughter of the prince of
Bakhtan,"
and she became well <19> instantly.
"Then this spirit who was with her said to
Khons-the-Provider-in-Thebes:"
"'Welcome in peace,"
great god who expels disease demons.
"Bakhtan is your home,"
its people are your servants
and I am your servant.
"<20> I shall return to the place I came from,"
so as to set your heart at rest about what you came for.
May Your Majesty command to spend a day of celebration
with me and the prince of Bakhtan!'
"Then this god nodded approvingly to his prophet, saying:"
"<21> 'Let the prince of Bakhtan make a great offering before this
spirit.'"
"During this that Khons-the-Provider-in-Thebes and the spirit did,"
the prince of Bakhtan stood by with his army
and was very frightened.
Then <22> he made a great offering
"before Khons-the-Provider-in-Thebes and the spirit,"
and the prince of Bakhtan organized a day of celebration for them.
"Then the spirit went in peace to where he wished,"
as Khons-the-Provider-in-Thebes had commanded.
"<23> The prince of Bakhtan rejoiced very greatly,"
together with everyone in Bakhtan.
"Then he took counsel with his heart, saying:"
'I will let this god stay here in Bakhtan.
I will not let him go back to Egypt.'
So <24> this god spent three years and nine months in Bakhtan.
"Then, as the prince of Bakhtan was asleep on his bed,"
he saw this god come out of his chapel.
He was a falcon of gold and flew to the sky toward Egypt.
He then awoke in fear
and said to the prophet of Khons-the-Provider-in-Thebes:
"'This god is here with us, whereas he should go back to Egypt."
Let his chariot go back to Egypt!'
"<26> Then the prince of Bakhtan let this god proceed to Egypt,"
and gave him very many gifts of every good thing
and very many soldiers and horses.
They arrived safely in Thebes
and Khons-the-Provider-in-Thebes went
"to the house of Khons-in-Thebes-Neferhotep,"
"and placed the gifts that the prince of Bakhtan had given him of every
good thing"
"before Khons-in-Thebes-Neferhotep,"
without him giving anything thereof to his own house.
Khons-the-Provider-in-Thebes arrived <28> safely at his house
"in year 23, second month of the Season of Growing, day 19,"
of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Usermare-sotpenre.
"May he be given life like Re, eternally!"
"<46:2> Year 50, first month of the Season of Harvest, day 22,"
"under the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Menkheperre,"
given life.
"His Majesty commanded the digging of this canal, <3> after his finding
it blocked up with stones;"
a ship could not sail on it.
"He travelled north on it, his heart being glad, having slain his
enemies."
The name of this canal is:
"&quot;Menkheperre (may he live eternally!) is the one who opens the
way as something perfect&quot;."
"It are the fishermen of Elephantine who will dig out <6> this canal
every year."
"after he had exercised kingship,"
and mankind and gods were (still) united.
"Mankind then <2> conspired against him,"
"while His Majesty (l.p.h.!) had grown old,"
"his bones were of silver, his flesh of gold, and his hair of real
lapis lazuli."
"His Majesty <3> perceived the conspiring that was done against him by
mankind,"
and His Majesty (l.p.h.!) said to those in his retinue:
"'Summon to me my Eye, and Shu, <4> Tefnut, Geb, Nut,"
and the fathers and mothers who were with me
"when I was in the primordial water,"
"and also my god Nun,"
and he shall bring his courtiers <5> with him.
"Bring them stealthily,"
so that mankind doesn't see and lose heart.
"Come with them to the palace,"
so that they may give their excellent counsel.
"<6> I shall return to the primordial water,"
to the place where I came into being.'
"Then these gods were brought,"
"and these gods came at his two sides, kneeling to the ground"
"before His Majesty,"
"that he might present his issue before the father of the eldest,"
"who created mankind, the king of the people."
And they said to His Majesty:
"'Speak <8> to us, that we may hear it!'"
Then Re said to Nun:
"'O eldest god, in whom I came into being,"
"and ancestor gods,"
"look, mankind, which issued from my Eye,"
they have conspired against me.
"Tell me what you would do about it,"
since I am deliberating
"and I cannot slay them until I have heard what you might say about
it.'"
Then the majesty of Nun said:
"'My son Re, god who is greater than he who begot him,"
"and most august than they who created him,"
be seated!
"<11> Great is the fear of you,"
since your Eye is on those who scheme against you.'
The majesty of Re then said:
"'Look, they have fled to the desert,"
because their hearts are fearful about what I said to <12> them.'
And they said to His Majesty:
"'Let your Eye go, that it may smite them for you,"
the schemers of evil.
There is no Eye that is more able than she to smite them for you.
<13> May it descend as Hathor!'
"This goddess returned after she had slain mankind in the desert,"
and the majesty of this god said:
"'Welcome in peace, Hathor, who helped the creator"
when I came to her!'
<14> And this goddess said:
"'As you live for me,"
"I have overpowered mankind,"
and it was pleasure to my heart.'
And the majesty of Re said:
"'I shall take power over them as king,"
<15> as he who diminished them.'
"Thus Sachmet came into being, concoction of the night,"
to wade in their blood as far as Herakleopolis.
Then Re said:
"<16> 'Summon to me swift, nimble messengers,"
that they may rush like a body's shadow!'
And these messengers were brought <17> immediately.
The majesty of this god then said:
"'Go to Elephantine,"
and bring me haematite in great quantity!'
And this haematite was brought to him.
Then the majesty of this great god ordered
"that the Braided in Heliopolis grind this haematite,"
while maidservants grind barley for beer.
"Then the haematite was put into this beer mash,"
and it became like human blood;
seven thousand jars of beer were made.
Then the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Re came
together with these gods
to see this beer.
When the day dawned <20> on which mankind would be slain
"by the goddess,"
"among their days of travelling south,"
the majesty of Re said:
'How good it is!
I will protect <21> mankind against her.'
And Re said:
"'Carry it to the place of which she had said &quot;I will slay mankind
there.&quot; '"
"The majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Re rose early,"
"<22> in the middle of the night,"
"to have this sleeping potion poured out,"
"and the fields were flooded three palms high with the liquid,"
by the might of the majesty of this god.
Then this goddess came in the early morning
"and found that these (fields) were flooded,"
and her gaze was pleased by it.
Then she drank and it pleased her heart.
"After she returned drunk without having perceived mankind,"
the majesty of Re said to this goddess:
"'Welcome in peace, O gracious one!'"
Thus beautiful women came into being in Momemphis.
<2> their tongues were not partial.
"Concerning [their] opposing [a briber],"
their tongues were not partial.'
"I opened my mouth to my soul,"
that I might answer what he had said:
"<5> 'This is much against me today,"
whereas my soul has not quarrelled <6> with me before.
"It is more than exaggeration,"
it is like I am ignored.
"May my soul not depart,"
may it attend to me in this!
He will not be guilty
"<9> that he [will distance himself] from my body,"
"from a net of cord,"
and it will not happen due to him
that he flees on the day [of suffering].
"<11> Look, my soul is disobeying me,"
"while I do not listen <12> to him,"
"is dragging me toward death,"
"before I have come to it,"
"<13> and is throwing me on the fire to burn me up,"
<14> [without] him suffering [therein].
He will stay close to me on the day of suffering.
"<16> He should stand on yonder side,"
like a praise singer does:
"<17> &quot;This is one who goes forth,"
as he has brought himself!&quot;
"My soul is ignorant about easing the misery that is due to life,"
and restrains <19> me from death
before I have come to it.
The west gives me pleasure.
Is it suffering?
It is a turning-point of life;
trees fall.
"Trample <22> on evil,"
and cast aside my misery!
"<23> May Thoth declare concerning me: &quot;The gods are
satisfied.&quot;"
May Khons defend me: <25> &quot;A true scribe.&quot;
May Re hear my utterance:
&quot;Stop the barque!&quot;
May Isdes defend me in the sacred hall.
<28> For my need is heavy
[to] <29> to weigh it on my behalf.
"It is pleasant that the gods should eliminate the concealment of my
body.'"
What my soul said to me:
'Are you not a man?
You <32> are alive!
What do you achieve
if you are concerned about life
<33> like a possessor of wealth?'
'I would say to someone who is about to go:
"<34> &quot;As to that burial,"
you are taken away from leaping around.
"Without <35> your taking care,"
every criminal will say:
<36> 'I will take you!'
"When you are dead,"
"but your name <37> still lives,"
that is a resting-place
attractive <38> to the heart.
"The west is a harbour,"
"If my soul listens to me,"
"my [neglectful] [brother],"
"with his heart in accord with mine,"
he <41> will prosper.
"I will make him reach the west,"
"like <42> someone in his pyramid,"
to whose burial a survivor has attended.
"I will create a breeze [over] <44> your corpse,"
and you will make another soul in weariness envious.
"I will create a breeze,"
"so that <46> it will not be freezing,"
and you will make another soul who is hot envious:
'I will drink water at <48> the watering-place.'
"I will heap up hay,"
<49> and you will make another soul who is hungry envious.
But if you restrain <50> me from a death
"in this form,"
you will not find a place on which you can rest in the west.
"Be favourable, my soul,"
"my brother,"
to what will happen!
An heir <53> who will make offerings
and stand at the tomb shaft on the day <54> of burial
will wish a bier
<55> at the necropolis.'
My soul opened his mouth to me
that he might answer what I had said:
"'If you would call burial to mind,"
"it is heartache,"
"it is bringing of tears,"
"making a man sad,"
"it is taking a man from his house,"
left on <59> a hill.
You cannot come up
to see <60> the sun.
"Those who built in granite,"
"who constructed and completed beautiful pyramids,"
"in <62> perfect realization,"
"when the builders became <63> gods,"
"their altars were bare,"
like those of weary ones
<64> who are dead on a riverbank
for lack of a survivor.
"<65> After the water has taken its toll,"
"and sunlight <66> as well,"
the fish of the waterside speak to them.
"Listen to me,"
as it is good to listen to people!
<68> Have a good time
and forget worries!
"A commoner <69> cultivates his plot,"
"he loads his harvest into a boat,"
"and tows the transport,"
as his feast is near
and he sees the darkness of a north wind arise.
He waits for a boat
"<73> as the sun sets and rises,"
and meanwhile his wife <74> and his children
perish in a pond surrounded at <75> night by crocodiles.
"At last he sits down,"
<76> and argues<note>Exact meaning is unclear.</note>:
"&quot;I do not weep <77> for that mother,"
for whom there is no escape from the west
<78> for another term on earth.
"But I will grieve for her children,"
"<79> who were crushed in the egg,"
who saw the face of Khenty
<80> before they had lived.&quot;
A commoner asks for <81^pre>dinner<81^post>.
His wife says to him:
&quot;It will be supper.&quot;
<82> He goes outside

until the moment <83> that he returns to his house.
He is like another man.
His wife <84> pleads with him
"but he can't hear her,"
"after he has [???],"
<85> incapable of communication.'
"I opened <86> my mouth to my soul,"
that I might answer what he had said:
'My name reeks through you
more than the smell of bird droppings
<88> on summer days
when the sky is hot.
"My name reeks through you,"
a haul of catfish
<90> on a fishing day

"<91> My name reeks through you,"
"more than the smell <92> of ducks,"
more than a covert of reeds <93> full of fowl.
"My name reeks <94> through you,"
"more than the smell of fishermen,"
more than the creeks <95> of marshes they have fished.
"My name reeks through you,"
"more than the smell of crocodiles,"
"<97> more than sitting on sandbanks<note>Following Faulkner

My name reeks through you

This was copied <155> from start to finish as found in writing.

"The road on which it travelled was exceedingly difficult,"
"it was difficult in the opinion of the people who were dragging great

I let a troop of recruits come

and the leaders with them were learned.
Strong-armed men said:
'We come to bring it.'
I was happy

The sight was exceedingly beautiful.
There was an old man

"Strong men together with invalids,"
their courage rose

A single one of them put forth the strength of a thousand men.
This statue came from the mountain as a block

If you see someone suffering from mucus
"and his belly is stiff <25,4> because of it,"
"while he has pain in his stomach,"
his mucus is in his belly
"before it has found a way out,"
"and it has no way out from him,"
then it will rot in his belly
"without coming out,"
"<25,6> and turn into worms."
It will completely turn into worms
until it becomes dead matter.
"Then he will pass it,"
and he will feel well immediately.
"If he doesn't pass it as <25,8> worms,"
"you will prepare laxatives for him,"

but without letting <6> a ship of the Nubians pass
"that sails north past Abu Sir, forever."
"<1> Year 47, third month of the Season of Inundation, day 10,"
under the majesty of
Horus: Mighty bull appearing in Thebes;
Two Ladies: Enduring of kingship like Re in heaven;
"Gold Horus: Sacred of appearance, mighty of strength;"
The king of Upper and Lower Egypt: Menkheperre;
"Son of Re, of his body, his beloved, lord of every foreign land:"
"Tuthmosis, beautiful of form."
"He created it as his monument for his father Amun-Re,"
"lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands,"
"in the fortress 'Slayer of the foreigners',"
<2> making for him a resting place of eternity
because he made the victories of My Majesty greater
than those of any king who had been.
"I seized the southerners under the command of his spirit,"
and the northerners in accordance with his guidance.
"He created the son of Re, Tuthmosis, ruler of Thebes,"
"given life like Re forever,"
"the good god who seizes with his arm,"
"who strikes the southerners and beheads the northerners,"
"who smashes the heads of the evil-minded,"
"<3> who carries out a massacre of the bedouin tribes of Asia,"
"who overthrows the rebels among the bedouin,"
"who subjugates the lands at the ends of the world,"
"who smites the nomads of Nubia,"
who attained the boundaries of the foreign lands
"of those who attacked him,"
who confronts the battlefield furiously.
"All foreign lands were united, standing prepared to fight as one."
"There were no deserters,"
"<4> relying on the numerous troops,"
with limitless people and horses.
"They advanced, their hearts being bold,"
without fear in their hearts.
"But the one mighty of strength overthrew them,"
"the one with powerful arm, who tramples his enemies."
"He is a king who fights alone,"
without crowds behind him.
He is more effective than <5> a million of numerous soldiers.
"No equal to him has been found: warrior, hero on the battlefield,"
"in whose vicinity there is no resistance,"
"who immediately overpowers all foreign lands,"
"as commander of his army,"
"while he rushes between the barbarians as a star that crosses the sky,"
"who enters the turmoil of battle,"
"while <6> his glowing breath [attacks] them with fire,"
"who eradicates them,"
while they lie in their blood.
"It is his serpent-diadem that overthrows them for him,"
his flame that drives away his enemies.
"The numerous army of Metjen was overthrown within an hour,"
"as perished as those who have never been,"
"as what the arms of the good god did,"
"who is great of strength in battle,"
"who carries out a massacre of everyone,"
"his only leader, the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Menkheperre"
(may he live forever!).
"He is Horus, with a powerful arm, a excellent fortress to his army,"
"a refuge to the subjects,"
"who attacks every land with infighting,"
"who rescues <8> Egypt on the battlefield,"
a protector who does not fear the rapacious.
He is a brave bull
"whose southern borders reach to the crest of the world,"
"to the ends of this world,"
"and the northern to the ends of Asia,"
to the supports of heaven.
They come to him with bowed heads
seeking his breath of life.
"He is a king valiant like Montu,"
"who robs but from whom one cannot rob,"
who tramples <9> all rebellious foreign lands
without there being anyone to protect them
"in that land of Naharina,"
which its lord had abandoned in fear.
I damaged his towns and his people
and I set fire to them.
"My Majesty turned them into ruins,"
so that they could not be reconstructed.
"I captured all their people,"
"who were brought as prisoners,"
"their cattle without limit,"
and their possessions as well.
"I took the crops away from them,"
"tore out their barley,"
and felled all their trees and all their fruit trees.
Their districts were massacred.
My Majesty devastated them
Now My Majesty travelled to the ends of Asia.
"I let many ships be constructed of cedar,"
"on the hills of the God's Land,"
"in the presence of the mistress of Byblos,"
and they were put on carts
pulled by oxen.
They went before My Majesty
to cross that great river
"that flows between this foreign land and Naharina,"
a king who is lauded for his arms in battle.
"He crossed the Euphrates after him who had attacked him, as chief of
his army,"
foreign lands of Metjen.
"But he fled from His Majesty to another land,"
"a distant place, in fear."
"Then My Majesty erected my stela on that mountain of Naharina,"
carved out of the mountain on the western side of the Euphrates.
"There is no enemy of mine in the southern lands,"
<14> and the northerners come bowing to my might.
"It is Re who commanded it for me,"
for I have grasped all that his Eye revolves around.
He gave me the land in its length and its breadth.
"I tied up the Nine Bows,"
"the islands in the middle of the ocean,"
the inhabitants of the Aegean Sea and the rebellious lands.
I returned southward to Egypt
"and subjugated Naharina,"
"greatly feared in the mouths of the bedouin,"
"their gates being closed because of it,"
and they couldn't go out for fear of the bull.
"He is a brave king, an excellent fortress to his army,"
a castle of iron.
"He attackes every land with his strength,"
without millions of men behind him.
A sure marksman
"everytime he takes aim,"
whose arrows cannot miss.
"One with powerful arm, the like of whom has never been,"
valiant Montu on the battlefield.
Now another victory that Re commanded for me:
"He again did for me a very brave act,"
at the lake of Niya.
He made me round up herds of elephants.
"My Majesty hunted them, a herd of 120."
Never had anything similar been done by a king
since the god of those who had received the white crown.
I have said this without boasting and without <18> lie.
"who guides My Majesty on the good road,"
through his excellent plans.
"He united for me the black land and the red land,"
what the sun revolves around is in my grasp.
"Now I'll speak again to you, so hear, people!"
<19> He conferred on me the foreign lands of Retjenu
"during the first expedition,"
"as they came to engage My Majesty,"
"being millions of men,"
"hundreds of thousands of the finest of all foreign lands,"
"standing on their chariots,"
"330 princes, each one thereof with his army."
"They were in the valley of Qina,"
ready for battle <20> in a narrow defile.
And a successful act took place against them caused by me.
My Majesty attacked them
"and they fled immediately,"
falling in heaps.
They entered Megiddo
"and my Majesty besieged them for seven months,"
until they came out
"beseeching My Majesty, saying:"
"'Give us your breath, our lord!"
The foreigners of Retjenu will not rebel again.'
Then that enemy and the princes who were with them had sent
"to My Majesty all their children,"
"with many tributes of gold and silver,"
"all their horses that were with them,"
their large chariots of gold and silver
"and those that were undecorated,"
"all their coats of mail,"
"their bows, <23> their arrows,"
and all their weapons.
This is what they had come with
"to fight and conspire against My Majesty,"
and now they brought them as gifts to My Majesty.
They stood on their walls giving praise to My Majesty
in order to be given the breath of life.
<24> Then My Majesty ordered that they be made to swear an oath:
'We will not again do evil against Menkheperre
"(may he live forever!), our lord,"
"in our lifetime,"
for we have seen his might.
He has given us breath as he wishes.
It is not an act of people.'
Then My Majesty ordered that they be granted passage
to their towns.
"They all went on donkeys,"
since I had taken their horses.
I captured their inhabitants for Egypt
and their properties as well.
"My father gave them to me,"
"whose plans do not fail,"
who sent My Majesty to seize the lands and all foreigners together.
"I overthrew them as he ordered, in the way that he used to do."
He let me smite all foreigners
and there was none who dared approach <27> me.
"My mace overthrew the Asiatics,"
and my <al>Ams</al>-mace smited the Nine Bows.
My Majesty subjugated every land.
"Retjenu is under my feet,"
the bedouin of Asia are subject to My Majesty.
"They are subservient to me as one,"
charged with tributes of millions of many things
"from the crest of the world,"
"and much gold from Wawat,"
its quantity without limit.
"One constructs there for the palace (l.p.h.!),"
"each and every year, 'eight'-ships"
the bedouin of Asia in ivory and ebony.
"Precious wood comes for me from Kush,"
consisting in branches of doum palm
and furniture without limit of southern acacia.
"My army hewed them in Kush,"
which was there by the millions.
which My Majesty had carried off in victory.
"from real cedar from Lebanon,"
which is brought to the palace (l.p.h.!).
"Precious wood comes for me to Egypt, brought south,"
"the pick of the God's Land,"
"which were assigned,"
"[<al>mAa</al>-wood] like alabaster for supply to the residence,"
without expiration of the coming of the appropriate season
of a single year.
"which is from cedar from conquests of My Majesty,"
who conferred on me all foreigners.
"I didn't give of it to the Asiatics,"
since it is wood that he likes.
"He subjugated, and they acknowledge my lord,"
and the misery from them has been pacified.
"that is at the sacred mountain,"
which was called the Thrones of the Two Lands among the people
when it wasn't known yet.

to carry out the regular watch;
there were two observers.
"A star fell, falling to their south."
The like had not happened before.
It struck them opposite to him.
"None of them offered resistance,"
and none looked back.
"They no longer had horses,"
"I returned southward, my heart being glad,"
"the one who had ordered this victory,"
"He placed the fear of me among all foreigners,"
and they fled far away from me.
All that the sun shines upon
is bound together under my feet.
My Majesty myself says:
"because I am very skilled in strength and victory,"
"which my noble father Amun, lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands, has
given to me."
"He has made me lord of the five portions,"
ruler of what the sun revolves around.

"There is no road to me,"
since he has sealed the entire land for me.
There is no limit to what became mine in victory.
He placed my might in Upper Retjenu.
"to the place where My Majesty is,"
at every season.
"The foreign land extracts for me everything good that is in it,"
which it had hidden from other kings.
"all kinds of precious stones,"
all kinds of sweet-smelling herbs
"that grow in Punt,"
and everything good from the southern land.
Everything that comes before My Majesty through trade is his.
I fill his house
"I will also give offerings, precious goods"
which his strong arm had attacked.
He ordered it to me against all foreigners.
"the Thrones of the Two Lands,"
"the great god of the primordial time,"
the primeval god who created your beauty.
He has given you every land.
Lead it for him who knows that you have come forth from him.

without my messenger being hindered.
all the gods of Upper and Lower Egypt.
"to travel south therein,"
"the southern land, to the palace (l.p.h.!)."
The princes of Retjenu dragged these flag poles
"with oxen to the harbour,"
and they came with their tributes
"to the place where His Majesty was,"
with all good products that were brought
"charged as tributes of the annual requirements,"
as all subjects of My Majesty.
Your fame has pervaded the crest of the world.
who will disrespect your plans.
"<1> The king of Upper and Lower Egypt Nebtawire,"
may he live forever!
<2> This wonder that happened to His Majesty:
"Creatures from the hills came down to him,"
"a pregnant gazelle came,"
"going with her face towards the people before her,"
"<4> while her eyes looked back,"
but she did not turn back
"until she arrived at this august mountain,"
"<5> at this block,"
"it being still in its place,"
for this lid of this sarcophagus.
"Then she gave birth upon it,"
while this expedition of <6> the king was watching.
"Then her neck was cut,"
and she was sacrified on it as burnt offering.
<7> It descended safely.
"Now, it was the majesty of this august god,"
"<8> lord of the foreign lands,"
who made the sacrifice to his son
Nebtawire
"(may he live forever!),"
"so that his heart might be joyful,"
that he might be <9> alive
upon his throne
"forever and ever,"
that he might celebrate millions of Sed-festivals.
"<10> Prince regent, count, leader of the city,"
"vizier, leader of all the officials of the judicial office,"

A royal commission executed by
"<4> the prince-regent,"

"and important in his dignity,"

"judge of nobility and subjects,"
"examinor of mankind,"

"He led millions of subjects,"

"'I was sent by my lord (l.p.h.!),"

"as a sender in whom are divine limbs,<note>Obscure passage.</note>"
to establish his monument in <10> this land.
"He chose me from his city,"
after I had been honoured before his courtiers.
"His Majesty commanded that an expedition went with me to this august
land,"

"Stonemasons, artisans,"
"officials,"
"sculpters, drawers, metalworkers,"
"goldsmiths,<note>Suggested by Faulkner (1962).</note> <12>

Every treasure of the treasury
and every office of the palace were united behind me.
I traversed land as if it were river
and upper valleys <13> as if they were waterways.
"I brought him a sarcophagus,"
an eternal memorial
that endures forever.
Never descended something like it from this land
since the time of the god.
"<14> The expedition descended without loss,"
"not a man perished,"
"not a soldier retreated,"
"not a donkey died,"
there was no injury to an artisan.
It happened to the majesty of my lord
"<15> as the destiny that Min created for him,"
"because he loved him so much,"
so that his spirit might endure on the Great Throne
in the kingdom of the two banks of Horus.
He made it something greater than itself.
"I am his favorite servant,"

"Start of work <2> at this mountain,"
on the sarcophagus of durable stone.
Again a wonder happened:
"A command was issued<note>Following Lloyd (1975), pp. 54-59, contra
note 1 of Barns (1972).</note>"
and the manifestation of this god was seen.
<3> His authority was evoked with the people.
"The hill was turned into water,"
"water issued from the roughness<note>Following Lloyd (1975), pp.
59-66, contra note 1 of Barns (1972).</note> of the stone;"
"a well was found in the middle of the valley,"
"<4> 10 cubits by 10 cubits on its every side,"
"filled with water to its edge,"
"purified and cleansed from gazelles,"
"hidden from the Troglodytes and foreigners,"
and passed in ascending and descending
"by soldiers of old,"
and kings who had been <6> before.
"No eye had seen it,"
"the glance of man had not fallen upon it,"
but to His Majesty himself it was revealed.
He had concealed it
<7> knowing the exact moment of this day.
He had planned the timing of this event
so that his authority might be seen
and one might know <8> the excellence of His Majesty.
He did something new in his mountainous land
for his son Nebtawire
(may he live forever!).
"Those who were in Egypt heard it,"
"<9> the people who were in Egypt,"
"both Upper and Lower Egypt,"
while they bowed their heads to the ground
"and praised the goodness of His Majesty,"
forever and ever.

<3> His Majesty commanded the erection of this stela
"for his father Min, lord of the foreign lands,"
"on this august mountain,"
"primordial one,"
"foremost in the land of the horizon-dwellers,"

The king of Upper and Lower Egypt Nebtawire
(may he live like Re forever!)
<11> says:
'My majesty sent
"the prince-regent,"
"leader of the city,"
"vizier,"
"overseer <12> of works,"
"royal confidant Amenemhet,"
together with an expedition of ten thousand men
"<13> from the southern provinces of Upper Egypt,"
"and from the south of Wabu<14>t,"
to bring me a precious block
"of the pure stone of this mountain,"
"whose excellence was made by Min,"
"for a sarcophagus,"
"an eternal memorial,"
and for monuments
"<16> in the temples of Upper Egypt,"
"as a mission of the king,"
"chief of the Two Lands,"
<17> to bring him his heart's desire
from the lands of his father Min.'
He created it as his monument
"<18> for his father Min of Koptos,"
"lord of the foreign lands, chief of the Troglodytes,"
"that he may be given very much life,"
and live like Re forever.
<19> Day 27.
"The lid of this sarcophagus descended,"
"a block of 4 cubits by 8 cubits by 2 cubits,"
<20> as it came from the works.
"Calves were slaughtered, goats were sacrificed,"
incense was put <21> on the fire.
An expedition of three thousand sailors
from the provinces of Lower Egypt
conducted it safely to Egypt.
"As for any people,"
"any scribe,"
"any learned man,"

They are to be massacred by the butchers

Their gods will not receive their white bread.

so that you may enjoy them.
<49:15> I have ordained it to you long ago.

<49:16> I have planned doing the useful deed.
"I have given you Punt in its entirety including the lands of the gods,"
"<50:1> the God's Land that has not been entered,"
and the Myrrh-terraces unknown to Egyptians.
"It was learned of by hearsay,"

And they say they beseech peace.
"'Why have you come here to this foreign land, unknown to Egyptians?"
<52:5> Did you descend on the road of heaven?
Have you travelled on water or on land?
"<52:6> How happy is the God's Land, which you have entered like Re!"
"As for the king of Egypt,"
is there no road to His Majesty
<52:7> that we may live on the breath that he gives?'
<52:9> Pitching camp of the envoy of the king and his expedition
on the Myrrh-terraces of <52:10> Punt

"The praise of me in the palace was greater than that of any sole
companion."
He raised me over his nobles.
I was [placed] <103> before those who had been <104> before me.
The cabinet of the palace assembled
"<106> to give praise according to <107> my appointment,"
"according to <108> the favour that came to pass <109> in the presence
of"
the pronouncement of the king himself.
Never happened the like to servants whom their lords had praised.
He knew my eloquence <114> while my appearance was youthful.
"I was honoured <116> with the king,"
"my praise <117> was with his courtiers,"
and the fondness for me was before <119> his companions.

revered.
<121> Another favour granted to me:
"<122> My eldest son Nekhet, born of Kheti, was appointed"
"to be ruler of Input,"
"<124> and to the inheritance of the father of his mother,"
was made sole companion
and was appointed to be chief of Upper Egypt.

establishing on its northern fields its boundary as far as Wabut.
"He divided <144> the great river along its middle,"
<145> its western side to Input
"reaching as far as the western lands,"
"when the prince regent and count Nakht son of Khnumhotep, justified
and revered, petitioned:"
"&quot;My waters do not know <149> the great favour from the
king.&quot;"
"Another prince <151> was appointed as sole companion,"
"<152> greatest of the companions,"
"numerous in gifts from the palace,"

<161> I kept alive the names of my forefathers
"that I'd found obliterated <163> upon the doorways,"
"legible,"
"accurately spelled,"
without <165> confusing one with another.
"He is an excellent son,"
"who perpetuates the names of the ancestors,"
"Khnumhotep son of Nehri, justified and revered."
<170> My foremost nobility was
"that I built a tomb,"
as a man should imitate what his father did.
"My father built for himself a mortuary chapel <174> in Mer-neferet,"
"of good limestone,"
in order to perpetuate <176> his name forever.
"He adorned it for eternity,"
"so that his name might live <178> in the mouths of the people,"
and remain in the mouths of the living
"<180> and on his tomb of the necropolis,"
"in his excellent house of eternity,"
"his place of everlastingness,"
according to the favour from <183> the king
and the love of him in <184> the palace.
He ruled his city when he was an infant
<185> before his circumcision.
<186> He executed a royal commission
and his two plumes danced
"when he was a child <188> at his mother's breast,"
for the king knew <189> his eloquence
"while his appearance was youthful,"
"Nehri son of Sobek-ankh,"
"justified and revered,"
<191> whom he raised over his nobles
<192> to rule his city.
Achievements of count Khnumhotep:
<193> I built a monument within my city.
I rebuilt a colonnaded hall that I found in ruins.
"I erected <196> it with columns anew,"
<197> inscribed with my own name.
<198> I kept alive the name of my father upon them.
I inscribed what I did upon every monument.
"I made a door of seven cubits of <201> cedar from Negau,"
"for the first doorway of the tomb,"
"and double doors of five cubits and two palms,"
<203> for the shrine of the august chamber
<204> that is within this tomb.
"The requisites for a mortuary offering of bread, beer, oxen and fowl,"
were on every monument that I built.
I inundated a pond
<207> and built its portal
that gave air to this colonnaded hall.
"My monuments within this city were greater that those of my
forefathers,"
"<210> a child of this city,"
and the monuments of its burial place were more excellent
than those of the ancestors built before me.
I was distinguished in monuments.
<214> I taught every craft <215> that had been forgotten
"within this city,"
"so that my name might be excellent upon <217> every monument that I
built,"
founded on me
without fault.
"I made the ship of another descend,<note>I take <hi>A50</hi> as

Praise the king within your bodies
embrace His Agency in your hearts.
Spread awe of him every day
Create rejoicing for him at every moment.
"He is the Insight into what is in hearts,"
his eyes probe every body.
He is the sun in whose leadership people live.
Whoever is under his light will be great in wealth.
He is the sun by whose rays people see.
"He is the one who brightens the Two Lands, more than the sun-disk."
"His heat scorches more than the flame of the torch,"
He is more devouring in his moment than fire.
"He is more fertile than the great Flood,"
he has filled the Two Lands with the trees of life.
"Noses are blocked when he falls to raging,"
"when he is peaceful, people breathe his air."
"He grants provisions for anyone in his following,"
"He grants provisions for anyone in his following,"
"The one he favours will be a lord of offerings,"
the one he rejects will be a pauper.
"The servant of the king will have revered status,"
his opponants
It is his power that fights for him
slaughter is what spreads respect for him.
watching over
founded upon the praise of his perfection.
He opens up the creation
that his heart desires
It is the life (that comes) of giving him adoration.
His opponants will be beneath
their corpses
"Sustenance is the king, Abundance is his word."
He is one who creates in his being.
"He is the heir of every god,"
the champion of the one who fashioned him.
They strike down his opponents for him.
"See His Agency may he live, flourish and be well, is in his palace of life, flourishing, health."
He is Atum at the tying of necks.
His protection is at the back of the giving of his powers.
"He is Khnum for everybody,"
the begetter who brings the populace into being.
"He is Bast, she who protects the Two Lands,"
he is praised for his sheltering.
He is Sekhmet against the one who transgresses what he has ordered.
The one whom he humbles will be bearer of travels.
Fight on his name
cleanse in his life.
Avoid the instant of sloth.
"The servant of the king will have revered status,"
but there can be no tomb for one who rebels against His Agency
his corpse will be something cast into the water.
"Do not hold back from the presents of his giving,"
"revere the Bee, adore his White Crown,"
worship the one who raises the Double Crown
"As you do this, your bodies will be well,"
you can find it (to be so) for eternity.
Enter the land by the gift of the king
"content in the place of eternity,"
"united with the cavern of the one within everlasting time,"
"with the shrine of your children bearing your love,"
and your heirs established in your positions.
"Copy my form, do not neglect my words."
Put into effect the rule I have drawn up.
Speak then to your children
for the word has taught since the time of Ra.
"I am a noble to be heard,"
whose lord has entered his reflections.
"Do not pass by my form, do not stray from my talent."
Avoid the instant of sloth;
a son who hears will be without any evils.
Does not every plan succeed by it?
You will be praising this after years.
Faithfulness to them assures success.
"Another theme to guide your hearts,"
as something to good effect before your workers:
"be commanding with people, collect your staff together,"
and fasten on the Agency of those who do.
It is people who bring what there is into being.
We live as men who have by their labour.
"If there is a lack of it, poverty takes power."
It is positions that produce offerings
"The one whose house is empty, his foundation wavers"
Their voices strengthen the walls.
The man who sleeps till dawn is the lord of a multitude;
there can be no sleep for the lone man.
"A lion is not sent on a mission,"
there is no cow that can be tied to the wall
"its voice would be like someone thirsty behind a well,"
more than fattened birds.
"The flood is desired, and they find it"
but there is no field for ploughing that creates itself.
It is the tethered bull that strikes the dueller.
"Anyone who is experienced in it, is keen-sighted."
Do not overwhelm the field-labourer with work.
"A man who complains, does he return to you next year?"
"If he is alive, there are his arms,"
"but if you flay him, his thoughts turn to homelessness."
Fix the produce-levy according to the grain harvest
There can be no opportunity for riches for an evil man;
His children do not find his residue.
The hard man causes the end of his life;
his children will not be devotees.
Affection will be for the one who passes him;
there can be no heir for the mean-spirited.
A lord of followers is great in respect
The loud-mouthed is an evil on the heart.
"It is the evil man who destroys his home ground,"
and the loved man for whom a city is founded.
Patience is the monument of a man
The man with power in a task turns about.
Does the cow reproduce for the hard man?
A herdsman of evil brings misery to his cattle.
Fight for people in every way
They are the flock that is good for their lord.
"It is they who find what one lives on,"
so they are good too for burial.
Watch over your ka-priests;
"if the son is lazy, there is still the wab-priest."
The one called an heir is the one who does favour.
"Initiate the noble, and recite on his name."
for doing is more useful to the doer than to the one for whom it is done;
it is the nourished dead who protect the one who is on earth.
"May you perish,"
"he who comes from the darkness,"
"who creeps in,"
"his nose behind him,"
<I.10> his head averted.
May he fail what he came for.
"May you perish,"
"she who comes from the darkness,"
"who creeps in,"
"her nose behind <II.1> her,"
her head averted.
May she fail what she came for.
Have you come to kiss this child?
I will not let <II.2> you kiss him.
Have you come to cause silence?
I will not let you put silence into him!
Have you come to hurt <II.3> him?
I will not let you hurt him!
Have you come to take him?
I will not let you take him from me!
I have provided his protection against you.

to the priesthood of the temple of Abydos
and its royal funerary chapel:
"'As the king is rejuvenating in your lives,"

"as you wish that Osiris is merciful to you,"

"'A thousand of bread and beer,"
"a thousand of oxen and fowl,"

"of the lord of eternity,"
for the spirit of
"the archer Neferenii',"
"because it is more beneficial to him who does it than to him for whom
it is done."
"Breath of the mouth is beneficial to the blessed,"
but it does not make one tired.
I am a blessed to whom one should listen;
a good reward belongs to him who does it.
<33><@1> you will not step on my clothes!'
And this peasant said:
'I shall do what you wish; my way is good.'
<35> And he went up higher.
Then this Nemtinakht said:
<36> 'Is my Upper-Egyptian barley to be a path for you?'
And this peasant said:
'My ways are good;
"the bank is steep, and <38^pre>the ways<38^post> are under barley"
for you block <39^pre>our path<39^post> with your clothes!
Will you then not allow us to pass <40> on the path?<@27>' <@11c>
<@2>Then one of the donkeys filled
<41> its mouth with a wisp of barley.
And this Nemtinakht said:
"<42> 'Look, I shall take away your donkey, peasant,"
because <43> it ate my barley.
<@3>It will tread (grain) for its offence.'
<44> This peasant then said:
'My ways are good!
A single thing <45> has been destroyed;
I will buy my donkey back for 10 times the value
if you take it away <46> for filling its mouth with a wisp of barley.
"Now, I <47> know the lord of this district;"
"it belongs to the high steward <48^pre>Rensi, son of Meru.<48^post>"
He is the one who restrains every thief in this entire land.
Shall I now be robbed in his district?'
Then this Nemtinakht <50> said:
'Is this not the proverb that people say:
<51> &quot;One mentions the name of a commoner
only on account of his lord.&quot;?
"I <52> am the one who is speaking to you,"
and it is the high steward whom you are referring to.'
"<53> Then, he took a rod of fresh tamarisk <54> to him,"
"and he thrashed all his limbs with it,"
took his donkeys away <55> and drove them to his district.
Then this peasant proceeded to <56> wail very loudly
on account of the wickedness of what was done to him.
<57> But this Nemtinakht then said:
"'Do not raise your voice, peasant,"
<58> or you will go to the abode of the Lord of Silence.'
"Then this peasant said: <59> 'You beat me, you rob my goods,"
and you even deprive me of <60> the lament from my mouth!
"Lord of Silence, may you give me back <61> my things,"
so that I need not scream
to startle you.'
<62><@4> Then this peasant spent a period of 10 days
"pleading with <63> this Nemtinakht,"
but he did not pay attention to it.
This peasant then went
<@5>to Herakleopolis in order to plead
"with the high steward <65> Rensi, son of Meru."
"He found him emerging from the door <66> of his house,"
to step into his official boat.
And this peasant said:
'May I be allowed to inform you
about this grievance.
"Perhaps <69> one may have a servant of your choice come to me,"
so that I may have him report to you about it.'
"And the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, had"
"<71> a servant of his choice go to him,"
and this peasant had him report back
about this entire matter.
"Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, accused"
<74> this Nemtinakht to the officials who were with him.
But then they said <75> to him:
'Perhaps it is a peasant of his who went to someone else beside him.
"<76> Look, that is what they do to peasants of theirs"
who have gone to <77> others beside them.
That is what they do.
"Is this a cause for <78> punishing this Nemtinakht,"
on account of a little natron <79> and a little salt?
"If he is ordered to replace <80> it, then he will replace it.'"
"But the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, remained silent."
"He did not answer <82> these officials,"
nor did he answer this peasant.
<83> Then this peasant came
to plead with
"<@8>the high steward <84^pre>Rensi, son of Meru<@6>.<84^post> <@17b>"
<@7>He said:
"'High steward, my lord, greatest of the great,"
"<85><@9> leader of all that is not and all that is,"
"if you go down to the Lake of <86> Truth,"
"you will sail on it with a fair wind,"
"<87> the bunt will not strip away your sail,"
"your ship will not lag,"
"no disaster will befall your rudder stock,"
"your yards will not break,"
"you will not founder when you land,"
"<90> no wave will carry you off,"
"you will not taste the evil <91> of the river,"
"you will not see the face of fear,"
but shy fish will come to you
and you will catch fatted fowl.
"For you are a father to the orphan,"
"<94> a husband to the widow,"
a brother to the divorced
and an apron <95> to the motherless.
Let me make your name in <96> this land according to every good rule:
"leader free <97> of greed,"
"great one free of arrogance,"
"<98> destroyer of falsehood, creator of truth,"
one who comes at <99> the voice of the caller.
<@10>I speak so that you will hear.
"Do justice,"
praised one whom the praised praise!
"Relieve the distress,"
for I <@19d> am burdened<@28>! <@19e>
"<@11>Examine <102> me, I am at a loss!'"
"<@12>Now, <103> this peasant said these words"
"in the time of the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt <104>
Nebkaure, justified."
"The high steward Rensi, son of Meru, then went"
before His Majesty and said:
"'My lord, <106> I have found one of these peasants who is truly
eloquent."
His goods have been robbe<@29>d <@20a>
<@13>and <108> he has come to plead with me about it.'
<109> And His Majesty said:
"As you wish to see me in health,"
you will delay him <110> here
without answering anything he says.
"So that he keeps <111> speaking, remain silent."
Then it will be brought to us
in writing
so that we may hear it.
<112> But provide sustenance for his wife
and children.
That one of these peasants comes here
is because his house is empty<@30>. <@20h>
"Furthermore, provide sustenance for this peasant <114><@21c> himself."
You will let the provisions be given to him
without letting him know
<115> that it is you who gave them to him.<@31>' <@21g>
"<@35>And he was given ten loaves of bread and two jars of beer <116>
every day."
"The high steward Rensi, son of Meru, gave them,"
"but he gave them to a friend of his, and it was he <117> who gave them
to him."
"Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, sent a message"
to the mayor of <118> the Wadi Natrun
"about making provisions for the wife of this peasant,"
consisting of three gallons of barley every day<@32>. <@21k>
"<119> Then this peasant came to plead with him for a second time<@33>,
<@22b>"
"<@34>and said: 'High steward, my lord, greatest of the great,"
"<120> richest of the rich,"
"whose great ones have one greater,"
"whose rich ones have one richer,"
"rudder of heaven, <122> beam of earth,"
plumb-line that carries the weight!
"Rudder, do not deviate!"
"<123> Beam, do not tilt!"
"Plumb-line, do not swing awry!"
A great lord <124> takes what is without owner
and robs only that.
Your possessions are in your house.
"<125> Half a litre of beer and three loaves of bread,"
what is it you expend to satisfy your dependants?
"A mortal man dies along with his underlings,"
or will you be a man of eternity?
"Is it not wrong,"
"a balance that is crooked, the pointer of a balance that errs,"
a truly correct man who strays?
"Look, justice is fleeing from you,"
expelled from <129> its place.
"Officials are doing evil,"
the norm of speech is biased
<130> and judges are carrying off what it seizes.
This means that he who twists speech from its correct sense
is <131> acting corruptly thereby.
"He who should give breath is suffocating on the ground,"
"he who should rest <132> is making people pant,"
"the arbitrator is a cheat,"
"he who should relieve distress is ordering its creation,"
"the harbour is flooded,"
he who should punish injustice is <134> doing evil.'
"Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, said:"
'Is what is on your mind of greater concern to you
than that my servant might seize you?'
But this peasant said:
'He who measures <136> heaps (of corn) is pilfering for himself;
he who fills for another is withholding from his amount;
he who should govern according to <137> the laws is ordering theft.
Who then will repel evil?
He who should dispel <138> weakness is acting corruptly;
he who should correct another is being crooked;
<139> he who should reproach another is an evildoer.
Do you find anything for yourself?
Redress is short but evil is long.
A good deed returns to its place of yesterday.
This is the precept:
"act for him who acts, <141> to make him act;"
it is thanking him for what he does;
it is parrying a thing before <142> shooting;
it is commissioning something from a craftsman.
"Would that a moment would destroy,"
"havoc in your vineyard,"
"decimation of your birds,"
destruction <144> among your water-fowl!
"He who should see has turned blind,"
"one who should hear deaf,"
<145> and one who should lead has gone astray.
"<146> Basket<note>Uncertain, but not altogether implausible if meant
figuratively as &quot;someone accumulating wealth&quot;; cf. B1
164.</note>! Have you (not) gone too far?"
Why do you act against yourself?
"Look, you are strong and powerful, your arm is strenuous,"
<148> but your heart is greedy
and mercy has left you.
How lamentable <149> is the poor man you ruin!
You are like <150> the messenger of Khenty.
"Look, you surpass <151> the Lady of Pestilence;"
"if something is not for you, it is not for her;"
"if something is not against her, it is not against you;"
"<152> if you won't do it, she won't do it."
Who possesses bread should be merciful
whereas brutality is for <153> the criminal.
"Theft suits those without belongings,"
<154> things are robbed by a criminal.
"But an evil act of someone without need,"
<155> is he not to be rebuked?
It is self-seeking.
But you are sated <156> with your bread
"and drunk with your beer,"
and you are rich in every respect.
"While the face of the helmsman is forward,"
the ship deviates as <158> it pleases.
While the king is in the stateroom
"and the helm is in your hand,"
<159> evil is placed near you.
"My plea is long, and the division is difficult."
&quot;What's with him there?&quot;
people say.
"Create shelter <161> so that your shore will be safe,"
"for look, your harbour is surrounded by crocodiles!"
<162> May your tongue be truthful
so that you won't go astray!
That organ in a man is his canker-worm.
Don't speak falsehood!
Beware of officials!
"<164> The judges are a fattened basket<note>Meant figuratively:
&quot;rich from bribes&quot;.</note>;"
"speaking falsehood is their herbage,"
it lies light on their hearts.
"O wisest <166> of all mankind,"
are you unaware of my case?
<167> Relieve all distress on the water!
"Look, I am under <168> way without a ship."
"Rescue all who are drowning,"
"<169> save the shipwrecked,"
rescue me in the domain <170> that is within your reach!'
And this peasant came
to plead with him for a third time.
"He said: <171> 'High steward, my lord,"
"you are Re, lord of heaven, with your courtiers."
"Everyone has a need for you, like <173> water."
"You are Hapi, who makes the meadows green"
and restores <174> mounds that have been ravaged.
Punish theft
<175> and protect the poor!
Don't become a flood against the suppliant!
Beware of the approach of eternity.
"<177> Desire to last, as is said:"
&quot;Doing justice is breath for the nose.&quot;
"<178> Inflict punishment on him who ought to be punished,"
and none will surpass <179> your rectitude.
Does the 'hand'-balance<note>&quot;Handwaage&quot;.</note> err?
"Is <180> the 'stand'-balance<note>&quot;Standwaage&quot;.</note>
biased?"
Is Thoth <181> lenient?
Then may you do evil!
You should set yourself equal to <182> these three;
"if the three are lenient, then you must be lenient."
Do not <183> answer good with bad.
Do not put one thing in place of another.
"<184> The spoken word is more persistent than weed<note>Lit.
&quot;<al>snmyt</al>-plants&quot;.</note>,"
to <185> reach the smeller with its retort.
"The one who waters mischief <186> to make
deception<note>Uncertain.</note> grow,"
"this is three times <187> to induce him to act!<note>I.e. &quot;this
is already the third time that I induce him to act!&quot;</note>"
Steer according to the sail.
"<188> Withdraw the flood, so as to do justice."
"Be careful that <189> you do not run aground, while at the tiller."
To straighten out the land <190> is to do justice.
"Do not speak falsehood, for you are mighty."
"Do not be light-hearted, <191> for you are weighty."
"Do not speak falsehood, for you are the balance."
"<192> Do not be careless, for you are the key."
You are just <193> like the balance:
"if it is crooked, then you must <194> be crooked."
"Do not deviate, but operate the rudder, pull <195> on the tiller rope."
"Do not rob, but act against the robber."
<196> A great one who is greedy is not (really) great.
"Your tongue is the pointer (of the balance),"
"your heart is the weight, and your lips are its arms."
"But if you shut your eyes to the impudent,"
<199> then who will repel evil?
"Look, you are <200> a dishonourable washerman"
"who is keen on destroying <201> friendship,"
one who wrongs his confidant for his client;
anyone who comes and supplies to him is his brother.
"Look, you are a ferryman <203> who ferries across anyone who has the
fare,"
a righteous man <204> whose righteousness has crumbled.
"Look, you are the chief of a workhouse"
<205> who won't let an unemployed person through at once.
"Look, you are <206> a hawk to the people,"
one who lives on defenceless <207> birds.
"Look, you are a cook whose joy is to slaughter,"
<208> and who is not touched by the gruesomeness thereof.
"Look, you are a herdsman;"
is it not bad for me then
that you cannot be prudent?
"May you become less like a ravenous crocodile,"
for shelter has vanished from the harbour of the entire land.
"<211> Hearer, you do not really hear."
But why do you not hear?
"Now <212> I have spoken out against the aggressor,"
and the crocodile retreats.
But what is <213> the gain thereof to you?
"The secret of the truth will be found,"
and falsehood will be cast on the ground.
Do not make provision for the following day
"before it has come,"
since one cannot know what is going to happen in it.'
"When this peasant had said these words,"
"the high steward Rensi, son of Meru,"
"went to the entrance of the portal,"
"<217> and made two guards turn against him with whips,"
and they thrashed all his limbs therewith.
Then this peasant said:
"'So the son of Meru <219> must go astray,"
since his face is blind to what he sees
"and deaf to what he hears,"
<220> and is straying from what it is reminded of.
"Look, you are a town <221> without a mayor,"
"like a meeting without a chairman,"
"like a ship <222> without a captain,"
like a gang without a leader.
"Look, you are a policeman who steals,"
"a major who accepts (bribes),"
<224> a district overseer who should restrain robbery
but who has become a pattern for the criminal.'
"<225> And this peasant came to plead with him for a fourth time,"
and found him <226> emerging from the gate of the temple of Arsaphes.
"<227> He said: 'Praised one,"
"may Arsaphes, from whose temple you have come, praise you!"
"Goodness has been harmed; there is no accumulation of it,"
nor is there casting of <229> falsehood on the ground.
Has the ferry sunk?
Who can be ferried across
when the one who should bring about the deed is unwilling?
Crossing <231> the river on foot:
"a good crossing, or not?"
"<232> Now, who can sleep till dawn?"
"For obstructed are going by <233> night, travelling by day,"
and letting a man attend <234> his truly good cause.
"Look, it is no use to tell <235> you this,"
for mercy has left you.
How lamentable is the poor man <236> you ruin!
"Look, you are a hunter <237> who slakes his desire,"
"bent on doing what he wants,"
"who harpoons hippopotami, <238> shoots wild bulls,"
catches fish and snares <239> birds.
"Yet there is none hasty of speech who is free of spluttering,"
<240> and none light of heart who is weighty of thought.
"Be tender-hearted, so that you will learn justice!"
Suppress your choice for <242> the good of him who enters humbly.
"For there is no brute <243> who attains excellence,"
and there is no impatient man <244> whom one turns to.
Let the eyes see so that the heart be informed.
"Don't be haughty in proportion to your might,"
so that evil doesn't reach you.
"<246> Tolerate one misdeed, and it will become two."
"It is the eater who tastes, <247> so one who is questioned replies;"
it is the sleeper who dreams.
"As for a judge <249> who ought to be punished,"
he is a pattern for the criminal.
"Fool, <250> look, you are found out!"
"Ignoramus, look, you <251> are questioned!"
"Bailer of water<note>Meant figuratively: &quot;someone
urinating&quot;.</note>, look, you are noticed!"
"<252> Helmsman, don't let your ship go off course!"
"Giver of life, <253> don't let people die!"
"Destroyer, don't let <254> people perish!"
"Shade, don't be as the blazing sun!"
"Shelter, <255> don't let the crocodile snatch!"
The fourth time already of pleading with you;
<256> shall I spend all day at it?'
And this peasant came to <257> plead with him for a fifth time.
"He said: 'High steward, my lord,"
"the <al>nyw</al>-fisherman<note>Uncertain.</note> is killing
<al>jy</al>-fish,"
"the fish-spearer is harpooning <al>awbbw</al>-fish,"
the <al>DAbHw</al>-fisherman <261> is after <al>pAqr</al>-fish.
The fisherman ravages the river.
"Look, you are the same."
"Do not defraud a poor man <263> of his property,"
a slight man whom you know.
"The belongings of a pauper are his breath,"
to take them away is to stop up his nose.
"You were appointed to hear cases,"
"to judge between litigants,"
and to <266> punish the robber.
"But look, what you are doing is supporting the thief."
"You are trusted,"
yet you <268> have become a transgressor.
"You were appointed to be a dike <269> for the pauper,"
so take care that he doesn't drown!
"But look, you <270> are the lake that pulls him under.'"
"And this peasant came <271> to plead with him for a sixth time,"
"and he said: 'High steward, my lord,"
"<272> lord who eradicates falsehood,"
"who creates truth and creates <273> all goodness,"
"who destroys [evil],"
"like when satiety comes <274> and ends hunger,"
"and clothes end nakedness,"
like when the sky becomes calm after a heavy storm
"and warms all who are chilled,"
"<277> like fire that cooks what is raw,"
like <278> water that quenches thirst!
See with <279> your own eyes:
"the arbitrator is a cheat,"
"<280> the appeaser is causing misery,"
and he who should mitigate is causing suffering.
"Cheating <282> diminishes justice, so render good account,"
and justice will be neither insufficient nor excessive<@14>. <@35c>
"<@15>If you acquire, then give to your fellow man,"
<284> for chewing is without merit.
<285> My anguish leads to separation
and my accusation brought departure;
one cannot know what is in the heart.
"<288> Don't be negligent, act at the accusation!"
"If you sever, who will join?"
"<289> The sounding rod is in your hand,"
"a rod that makes waters accessible that have stayed behind (during low
tide)."
"<290> If a ship goes down, it is looted"
and its cargo perishes on the ground
<291> at every embankment<@16>. <@36e>
"You are educated, enlightened <292> and accomplished,"
but not for cheating!
"You act the same as everyone,"
<293> and your environment is corrupt.
<@17>Molester of the entire land!
"The cultivator of wickedness is <295> watering his garden with evil,"
to make his garden grow <296> with falsehood
and to water everlasting doom.'
"<297> And this peasant came to plead with him for a seventh time,"
"and he said: <298> 'High steward, my lord,"
"you are the helm of the entire land,"
the land sails in accordance with your command.
"You are the equal of Thoth,"
<300> who judges without being partial.
"My lord, may you condone that a man calls upon you"
<301> concerning his just cause.
"Don't be outrageous, it is not for you!"
<302> One who was happy becomes anxious.
"Do not scheme for what has not yet come,"
<303> do not rejoice in what has not yet happened!
Considerateness extends friendship
<304> and dismisses an offence that happens;
one cannot know what is in the heart.
"<305> Subverter of the law, destroyer of rectitude!"
There will be no poor man <306> alive
if justice does not attend to him when he is robbed.
"Now, <307> my body is full (of misery)"
and my heart is laden (with grief).
It comes from my body because of the condition thereof:
"<308> it is the breach of a dike, its waters pouring through,"
as my mouth opens to speak.
"So, I have now plied my sounding rod,"
"bailed <310> my water,"
given vent to what was on my mind
and washed my dirty linen.
<311> My speech is done
"and my misery has ended up before you,"
what (more) <312> do you need?
"Your neglect will lead you astray,"
your avarice <313> will befool you
and your greed will make you acquire enemies.
<314> Will you even find another peasant like me?
<315> Or will the lazy petitioner be waiting at the door of his house?
"<316> There is none silent whom you let speak,"
"none sleeping whom you roused,"
"<317> none downcast whom you enlivened,"
"none speechless whose mouth you opened,"
"none ignorant whom you let know,"
none foolish whom you educated.
"<319><@36> Yet officials should be people who dispel injustice,"
"lords of goodness,"
"<320> craftsmen in creating what is,"
people who mend a severed head.'
"And this peasant came to plead with him for an eighth time,"
"and said: 'High steward, my lord,"
one sinks low through greed.
"A greedy man is without achievement,"
<323> he achieves only failure.
"You are greedy but it does nothing for you,"
you steal <324> but it's of no benefit to you.
You who should let a man attend his truly good cause!
"<325> In fact, your possessions are in your house"
and your stomach is full;
the barley brims over since it is so abundant
<326> and its excess perishes on the ground.
"<327> Thief, robber, snatcher!"
The officials who were appointed to repel <328> evil
should be shelters from the agressor;
the officials who were appointed to eradicate <329> falsehood!
And the fear of you wouldn't permit appealing to you?
<@18>You do not perceive my heart!
The humble man <330> who returns
"to make a complaint to you,"
"he cannot fear him to whom it is submitted,"
<331> though no brother of his can be fetched to side against you
in the street.
"Your plots of land are in the country,"
<332> your earnings are in the estate
and your provisions in the storehouse.
"Officials are giving to you,"
<333><@19> and you are still robbing.
Are you a thief?
"People are ushered in to you,"
"<334> troops being with you,"
for the division of plots of land.
"<@20>Do justice for <335> the Lord of Justice,"
whose justice has justice!
"<336> Pen, papyrus, palette of Thoth,"
<337> beware of doing evil!
"The goodness of a good man is good to him,"
<338><@21> but justice is for eternity.
It goes down <339> with him who does it to the necropolis.
"When he is buried,"
"and earth envelops him,"
his name is not effaced on earth
and he is remembered on account of the goodness.
This is the norm of the divine word.
"If it is a 'hand'-balance,"
then it is not crooked.
"If it is a 'stand'-balance,"
then it is not biased.
"Look, I <345> will come,"
"and another will come,"
so you should inquire!
<346> But do not respond as one who questions a humble man.
Do not attack one who cannot attack.
"You show no mercy, you are not troubled<@22>, <@44q>"
"<@23>you do not destroy,"
nor do you give me a reward for this good speech
that comes forth from the mouth of Re himself!
<351> Speak justice and do justice<@24>! <@45c>
"<@25>For it is mighty,"
"<352> it is great, it is enduring,"
"one will find its trustworthiness,"
<353> it will lead to blessedness.
Can a balance be crooked
<@26>when it is its pans that weigh things?
There can be no excess of rectitude.
"An evil deed cannot reach <357> harbour,"
but the hindermost will reach land.<@0>' <@46c>
<@1>So act accordingly<@2>! <@35d>
"and your share of the cargo will be what you seize,"
at every embankment.
<14><@3> It is known<@4>: <@36f>
and every man in your environment is corrupt<@5>. <@36l>
"none sleeping whom you roused,"
<48> uneducated whom you instructed<@16>. <@40l>
"And the fear of you wouldn't permit me to appeal <62> to you<@6>?
<@42e>"
"<63> to make his complaint,"
you cannot fear him who submits it to you.
"<67> are giving gifts to you<@7>, <@42p>"
Are you a thief then?
"Are people ushered in to you,"
"troops <69> being with you,"
for the division of plots of land<@8>? <@43f>
"When goodness is good, goodness is good indeed<@9>, <@43l>"
The norm of the divine word<@10>: <@44d>
"<@11>you do not flee<@12>, <@44r>"
<85><@13> Do justice to me<@14>! <@45d>
A balance cannot be crooke<@15>d <@45l>
"<91><@0> And this peasant came to plead with him for a ninth time,"
"<92> and said: 'High steward, my lord,"
"the tongue of people is their 'stand'-balance,"
and it is the 'hand'-balance that detects <94> deficiency
and inflicts punishment on him who ought to be punished.
One sets the standard after you.
<96> but the truth returns to correct it.
"Truth is an aspect of falsehood,"
which means it is made to thrive
but it is not gathered in.
"<98> When falsehood sets out, it goes astray."
It cannot cross in a ferry
and it cannot row.
"<100> As for him who is enriched by it,"
he has no children <101> and no heirs on earth.
"As for him who sails <102> with it,"
"he cannot reach land,"
his boat cannot moor in its harbour.
"Don't be heavy, you haven't been light!"
"<104> Don't delay, you haven't been swift!"
Don't be partial!
Don't listen to <105> the heart!
Don't disregard someone you know!
Don't be blind to <106> someone who looks to you!
Don't fend off someone who appeals to you!
"May you abandon <107> this neglect,"
and may your verdict be accounced!
<108> Act for him who acts for you
and don't listen to anyone who is against him!
Summon a man <109> concerning his just cause!
"There is no yesterday for the negligent,"
<110> no friend for him who is deaf to truth
and no holiday for the greedy.
"The accuser becomes <112> wretched,"
"wretched to be a suppliant,"
<113> and the opponent becomes a murderer.
"Look, I am pleading with <114> you"
but you do not hear it.
I will go and plead <115> concerning you with Anubis.'
"Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, sent two guards"
to bring him back.
"<117> And this peasant was afraid,"
thinking it was done <118> to punish him
on account of these words that he had said.
And this peasant said:
"<119> 'A thirsty man's approach of water,"
"the reach of a nurseling's mouth for milk,"
<121> such is death
for him who prays to see it come
<122> when his death comes tardily for him.'
"Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, said:"
"'Don't be afraid, peasant!"
"Look, <124> you will arrange the matter with me.'"
But this peasant swore <125> an oath:
'So I will eat your bread
and drink <126> your [beer] forever!'
"The high steward Rensi, son of Meru, said:"
'Now wait here
<128> and hear your petitions!'
And from a new papyrus roll he had every petition read out
according to [its] content.
"<130> Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, delivered them"
<131> to the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt
"Nebkaure, justified,"
and they pleased his heart
<132> more than anything in this entire land.
Then His Majesty said:
"<133> 'Pass judgement yourself, son of Meru!'"
"And the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, sent two guards to [fetch
Nemtinakht]."
<135> Then he was brought
<136> He found six persons
<142> This was copied [from start to finish as found in writing].
"<1.1> There was a man called Khunanup<note>Transcription following
Parkinson (1997).</note>."
"He was a peasant of the Wadi Natrun,"
"<1.2> and he had a wife called Meret<note>Transcription following
Parkinson (1997).</note>."
This peasant said to this wife of his:
"'Look, I am going <1.3> to Egypt"
to fetch provisions there for my children.
Go and measure for me the barley
<1.4> that is in the barn as the remainder of yesterday's barley.'
Then he measured for her
six heqat of barley.
<1.5> Then this peasant said to this wife of his:
<1.6> But prepare for me the six heqat of barley
"as bread and beer for every day,"
so that I shall live on it.'
"<1.7> Then this peasant left for Egypt,"
after he had loaded his donkeys
"<2.1> with vine<note>Uncertain.</note>,"
"<2.2> purple nutsedge<note>Uncertain.</note>,"
"<2.3> natron,"
"<2.4> salt,"
"<2.6> pieces of wood from Farafra,"
"<2.7> hides of panthers,"
"<3.1> skins of golden jackals,"
"<3.2> pondweed,"
"<3.3> <al>anw</al>-stone,"
"<3.4> <al>tnm</al>-plants,"
"<3.5> wild carrot<note>Uncertain.</note>,"
"<3.6> serpentine<note>Uncertain.</note>,"
"<4.1> <al>mjswt</al>-plants,"
"<4.2> ochre<note>Uncertain.</note>,"
"<4.4> wild mint<note>Uncertain.</note>,"
"<4.5> hedge plants,"
"<4.6> pigeons<note>Uncertain.</note>,"
"<4.7> <al>narw</al>-birds,"
"<5.1> gutted fish and plucked fowl,"
"<5.2> <al>wbn</al>-plants,"
"<5.3> <al>tbsw</al>-shrubs,"
"<5.4> <al>gngnt</al>-beans,"
"<5.5> fenugreek<note>Following Faulkner (1962); not confirmed by
Hannig (1995).</note>,"
<5.6> and anise<note>Uncertain.</note>;
<6.1> abound with all good products of the Wadi Natrun.
"<6.2> This peasant then went south <6.3> to Herakleopolis,"
"and he arrived in the district of Per-<6.4>Fefi<note>Transcription
following Parkinson (1997).</note>,"
to the north of Mednit.
He came across a man <6.5> standing on the embankment.
"His name was Nemtinakht<note>Transcription following Parkinson
(1997).</note>"
"and he was the son of a man <6.6> called Isry<note>Transcription
following Parkinson (1997).</note>."
"These were liegemen of the high steward <6.7> Rensi<note>Transcription
following Parkinson (1997).</note>, son of Meru<note>Transcription
following Parkinson (1997).</note>."
"And this Nemtinakht said,"
"when he saw <7.1> the donkeys of this peasant,"
which were desirable to his heart:
<7.2> 'Would that I had some divine image
with which I could rob the goods of this peasant!'
"Now, the house of this Nemtinakht was at a waterside path"
"that was narrow, it was not broad:"
<7.5> it measured the width of a loincloth.
"Its one side <7.6> was under water,"
the other under barley.
This Nemtinakht then said to a servant of his:
"'Hurry, <7.7> and bring me a cape from my house!'"
And it was brought to him immediately.
"<8.1> Then he spread it out on the waterside path,"
"<8.2> so that its hem came to rest on the water,"
and its selvage <8.3> on the barley.
And this peasant came on the public path.
This Nemtinakht then said:
"'Beware, <8.5> peasant<@0>, <@10b>"
"'But look, your donkey"
<9.6> is eating my barley<@2>!
<12.3> to Your Fearsomeness.<@3>' <@14c>
<12.5> This peasant then went sout<@4>h
<14.1> Then this peasant came
to plead with hi<@7>m <@17a>
<@5>for the first time<@6>. <@17c>
"<14.2> 'High steward, my lord, great one, lord of the great<@8>,
<@17e>"
Cast evil on <16.3> the ground<@9>! <@18g>
"<16.5> Relieve my distress,"
for I <16.6><@19d> am laden with sorrow
<@15>and <16.7> faint from it<@10>! <@19f>
<16.8> in distress!<@11>' <@19h>
"<17.5><@16> by a man who is my peer<@12>, <@20b>"
so that his speech will be brought to us
in writing.
But provide sustenance for the wife of this peasant
provide sustenance for this peasant <@21c> himself. <@21d>
without him knowing
"<@18>They were given to friends of his,"
<18.7> and his friends gave them to him<@22>. <@21h>
"<19.4><@19> Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, gave <19.5>
provisions"
"He gave them to friends of his,"
<19.7> and his friends gave them to him.
"<26.4> Look, I am laden with <26.5> sorrow."
"Look, I am in your hands,"
so you should take account of me!
"Look, I am in distress."
"<1> Words said by Amun-Re,"
lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands:
"'May you come to me and rejoice at seeing my beauty,"
"my son, my avenger, Menkheperre (may he live forever!)."
"I shine for your sake,"
my heart <2> is glad
about your beautiful arrival at my temple.
My hands have endowed your body with protection and life.
How pleasant is your grace to my breast!
I established <3> you in my sanctuary and I performed wonders for you.
I gave you valour and strength against all foreign lands.
"I put your authority and fear of you in all lands,"
and dread of you as far as <4> the four supports of heaven.
I increased awe of you in every body.
I put the fame of Your Majesty throughout the Nine Bows.
"The princes of all foreign lands are gathered in your grasp,"
<5> I stretched out my own hands
and I bound them for you.
"I tied up the Nubian nomads by tens of thousands and thousands,"
and the northerners by hundreds of thousands of captives.
<6> I made your enemies fall under your feet
"so that you could crush the contentious and deceitful,"
"for I entrusted the earth to you, in its length and its breadth,"
and westerners and easterners are under your command.
<7> You trample all foreign lands
while your heart is glad.
"There is no one who dares come near to Your Majesty,"
but while I was your guide
you attained them.
"You crossed the water of the Euphrates <8> of Naharina,"
with strength and might that I created for you.
They heard your battle-cry and hid in holes.
I deprived their noses of the breath of life.
<9> I set the dread of Your Majesty in their hearts.
"My serpent-diadem on your head consumes them,"
"it makes easy prey of the evil-minded,"
"<10> it devours the Aegean islanders with its flame,"
it severs the heads of the Asiatics
and none of them is spared.
The enemy staggers because of its might.
<11> I let your power pervade all lands.
The light of the uraeus is your protection.
There will be no rebel against you in what heaven surrounds.
"They come bearing tributes on their backs,"
bowing to Your Majesty as I commanded.
"I let the aggressors who come near you become weak,"
"with fearful hearts, their bodies trembling."
"<13> I came to let you crush the princes of Palestine,"
"spreading them out under your feet throughout their lands,"
"and to let them see Your Majesty as the lord of radiance,"
while you shine before them in my likeness.
<14> I came to let you crush those in Asia
"and strike the heads of the Asiatics of Retjenu,"
"and to let them see Your Majesty equipped with your regalia,"
while you carry weapons on a chariot.
<15> I came to let you crush the eastern land
"and trample those in the districts of the God's Land,"
"and to let them see Your Majesty as shooting star,"
which sheds its flame in fire and emits its fragrance.
"<16> I came to let you crush the western land,"
"Keftiu and Isy being in awe of you,"
"and to let them see Your Majesty as a young bull,"
"stout-hearted, sharp of horns, invincible."
"<17> I came to let you crush the Aegean islanders,"
"the lands of Metjen trembling for fear of you,"
"and to let them see Your Majesty as a crocodile,"
"lord of fear in the water, unapproachable."
"<18> I came to let you crush those on the 'turtle backs',"
"the sea people hearing your battle-cry,"
"and to let them see Your Majesty as avenger,"
appearing on the backs of his victims.
"<19> I came to let you crush Libya,"
"the islands of the people of Wetnet being in the power of your might,"
"and to let them see Your Majesty as a wild lion,"
while you turn them into corpses throughout their valley.
"<20> I came to let you crush the boundaries of the world,"
"what the ocean surrounds being enfolded in your grasp,"
"and to let them see Your Majesty as possessing the wings of Horus,"
who takes what he sees at will.
"<21> I came to let you crush the border people<note>Following
Lichtheim (1976).</note>"
"and fetter the bedouin as captives,"
"and to let them see Your Majesty as an Upper Egyptian jackal,"
"lord of speed, runner, rover of the Two Lands."
"<22> I came to let you crush the Nubian nomads,"
"who are in your grasp as far as Shat,"
"and to let them see Your Majesty as your two brothers,"
whose hands I joined together for you in victory.
"<23> I placed your two sisters as protection behind you,"
"and the arms of My Majesty are raised, warding off evil."
"I gave you protection,"
"my son, my beloved, Horus, mighty bull who appears in Thebes,"
"<24> Tuthmosis (may he live forever!),"
who does for me all that my spirit desires.
"You have erected my sanctuary as a work of eternity,"
made longer and wider than before.
<25> his beauty adorns Amun-Re&quot;<note>Uncertain.</note>.
Your monuments are greater than those of any king who has been.
"I commanded you to make them,"
and I am satisfied with them.
"I established you on the Horus throne for millions of years,"
so that you may lead the living forever.'
Beginning of the collection of fine words
"Said by the man of the elite, foremost of arm"
god's father and beloved of the god
eldest son of the king of his body
"overseer of the city, vizier Ptahhotep"
in teaching the ignorant to be wise
"according to the rules of fine words,"
"something useful to whoever heeds,"
and something harmful to whoever transgresses it.
Then he addressed his son:
"Do not be proud on account of your knowledge,"
but discuss with the ignorant as with the wise.
The limits of art cannot be delivered;
there is no artist whose talent is fulfilled.
"Fine words are more sought after than greenstone,"
but can be found with the women at the grindstone.
If you meet an opponent in his moment
"A director of heart who is superior to you,"
bend your arms and bow;
"do not take up your heart against him,"
for he will not be swayed for you.
You can belittle bad speaking
by not clashing with him in his moment;
"it will mean he is called a fool,"
when your self-restraint has subdued his excess.
If you meet an opponent in his moment
"Your equal, a man from your levels,"
"silence is how you establish your superiority over him,"
"while he is bad mouthing,"
"greatly to the disgust of the assessors,"
and your name is the good one in the mind of the officials.
If you meet an opponent in his moment
"Who is a poor man, and not your equal,"
do not vent your heart on him by his wretchedness.
Put him on land for him to oppose himself.
Do not pour out your heart at the man facing you.
The demolition of a wretched heart is a difficult matter.
What you wish will be done;
beat him with the hostility of the officials.
If you are to be among leaders
"at a command for the condition of the multitude,"
"seek out for yourself every effective moment,"
until your condition reaches faultlessness.
"What is right is great, and what is keen endures."
It has not been overturned since the time of Osiris.
The one who overlooks laws is punished;
that is what is overlooked in the sight of the greedy.
"It is the small-minded that seize riches,"
but crime never managed to land its rewards.
Whoever says 'I snare for myself'
does not say 'I snare for my needs'.
The final part of what is right is its endurance;
of which a man says 'that is my father'
Do not cause fear among people
God punishes with the same.
Anyone who says 'I can live by it'
will lack bread for his statement.
Anyone who say 'I can be powerful'
will have to say 'I snare against myself by my cleverness'.
"Anyone who says he will strike another,"
will end by being given to a stranger.
If you are a man at a sitting
"at the table place of one greater than you,"
"take whatever he causes to be set before you,"
"do not stare at what is before him,"
do not pierce it with many glances
Pressing it is an offence to the ka.
Do not speak to him until he has requested:
you never know what may displease.
"Speak when he questions you,"
and your speech will please.
"A great man, when he is at a meal,"
"behaviour following the command of his ka,"
"he will give to the one he favours,"
that is the night-time behaviour that happens
only a fool complains about it.
If you are a man of entry
"sent by official to official,"
be precise in the form he sent you
carry out the mission for him as he says.
"Guard against harming with words,"
embroiling official with official.
Grasp what is right by its likeness;
an outburst of the heart is not repeated
from the speech of all people.
"If you plough for plants on the margins,"
the god grants it to be great by your hand
Do not inflate your mouth beside your neighbours;
to inspire awe by being silent is greater.
"A master of character who is master of wealth,"
he seizes like a crocodile in the council.
"Do not scorn the childless man,"
do not bemean by boasting over it.
Even a father can have his plenty of grief;
a mother who has given birth may be less happy than a maid.
"It is the lone man that the god fosters,"
while the lord of a clan may beg to be followed.
"If you are weak, follow a man of excellence"
and all your conduct will be good before god.
"When you have known lesser men before,"
"do not be proud against him,"
from what you knew of him before.
"Respect him according to what he has become,"
for goods do not come of their own accord.
This is their law for their desire.
An overflow - he has assembled it of himself.
"It is the god who makes him excellent,"
and protects him while he sleeps.
Follow your heart as long as you live.
"Do not make a loss on what is said,"
do not subtract time from following the heart.
Harming its time is an offence to the ka. Do not deflect the moment of every day beyond establishing your heart.
"As things happen, follow (your) heart."
There is no profit in things if it is stifled.
If you are a man of excellence
"and produce a son in the favour of god,"
"if he follows precisely the outline of your character,"
"and ties your things to their proper place,"
"do everything good for him,"
"for he is your son, he belongs to the shooting of your ka"
Do not separate your heart from him.
Seed may make a disputant;
"if he wanders, and breaks your advice,"
"and has rebelled against all that is said,"
"and his mouth wanders into evil speech,"
battle him in all his words.
He who attacks you is the one they have condemned.
It means it was decreed that he be smjtten in the womb.
"Their guidance does not stray,"
their stranded never find a ferry.
If you are in the approach hall
stand and sit at every step
as was ordered to you on the first day.
Do not waver - that causes your expulsion
"The sight of the one who enters to report is keen,"
the space of the one he has summoned is broad.
"The approach hall follows regulations,"
every move according to the measure.
It is the god who promotes a place
Those who push forward are not made.
If you are to be with people
"appoint for yourself people you can trust,"
and be trustworthy.
The man without speech running through his body
is the one who becomes a commander himself.
A master of goods - what is he like?
Your good name is that you do not speak.
Your body is fattened for you more than your contemporaries.
You receive praise from those you do not know.
"When a heart heeds only its belly,"
it puts resentment of it in place of love of it.
"His heart is afflicted, his body unkempt."
"The great of heart is the gift of god,"
the one who obeys his body belongs to the enemy.
Report your matters without hesitating
give your advice in the council of your master.
"Anyone fully fluent in speaking,"
will find no difficulty in being a messenger in reporting.
No one will contest 'but who can know it?'
It is the one who exceeds his field who comes unstuck -
"if he intends to prevail by it,"
he has to be silent at the words 'I said so'.
If you are a leader
"with broad scope in what is commanded to you,"
"you should do outstanding things,"
so as to be remembered in days to come.
A case does not arise out of the midst of praises.
The hidden beast intrudes - and then there is resistance.
If you are to be a leader
"be patient in your hearing when the petitioner speaks,"
do not halt him until his belly is emptied
of what he had planned to have said.
The victim loves to sate his heart
even more than accomplishing what he came for -
"if a petition is halted,"
people say 'but why did he break that rule?'.
"Not everything for which he petitions can come to be,"
but a good hearing is soothing for the heart.
If you wish friendship to last
"within a house you may enter,"
"as master, as brother, or as friend,"
"anywhere you may enter,"
resist approaching the wife.
"It is not good for the place where it is done,"
"It is not clever to open it up,"
A thousand men are tied against what is good for them;
"a little moment is like a dream,"
but death is reached by knowing it.
"It is a vile twist to shoot the enemy,"
"it comes out on his doing, the heart restraining him."
"The one who fails by lusting for her,"
no plan succeeds by his hand.
If you wish your conduct to be good
"and to save yourself from all evil,"
resist the opportunity of greed.
"It is a sore disease of the worm,"
no advance can come of it.
"It embroils fathers and mothers,"
with mother's brothers.
"It entangles the wife and the man,"
"it is a levy of all evils,"
a bundle of all hatefulness.
"The man endures whose guideline is Right,"
who proceeds according to his paces.
He can draw up a will by it.
There is no tomb for the greedy hearted.
"Do not be greedy over a share,"
"do not be jealous of what is not your due,"
do not be greedy against your kin.
The mild man receives more respect than the strong.
"The one who goes out under his kin is a miserable man,"
deprived of the profit of speech.
A fraction of the object of greed
creates a quarreler out of a cool temperament.
"If you are excellent, found your household,"
love your wife within reckoning.
"Fill her belly, clother her back,"
ointment is the remedy for her body.
Gladden her heart as long as you live.
It is a field of benefit for its lord.
Do not impose her in affairs.
"Distance her from power, restrain her."
Her eye is her storm when it sees.
This is what keeps her in your house.
"Your quelling her, is water."
The womb puts her in her arms.
In her turmoil a canal is made for her.
"tp aqw=k m xprt n=k
Make your staff happy with what has come to you,"
it has come to one whom the god favours.
Anyone neglecting the happiness of his staff
is called a spirit of hoarding.
"No one knows what is coming, when planning tomorrow."
The spirit of the correct man is the spirit that brings happiness.
"If moments of praising arise,"
it is the staff who would cheer.
Food cannot be brought to town 
staff are fetched when there is shortage.
Do not repeat slander
and do not listen to it.
It is the result of the hot-headed.
"Repeat a word after seeing,"
not heard entirely skewed.
"See, what is before you is fine knowledge."
"When a levy is decreed to take place,"
"the one made to exact it is hated, by law."
"Slander is like a moment of dreaming,"
See what is the remedy for the dream -
concealment.
"If you are as a man of excellence,"
"sitting in the council of his master,"
rally every heart to excellence.
Your silence is more benefit than creeping talk.
You should say what you know how to explain.
"There are artists of words in the council,"
speaking is more difficult than any labour.
The one who can explain is the one who makes it work.
"If you are powerful in causing respect for you,"
"by knowledge, by calming in speech,"
"do not order people, except by the guidelines."
The aggressive man ends up in trouble.
"Do not have your heart too high, or it will be brought down."
Do not stay silent if it makes you stumble.
"When you answer the speech of a fiery man,"
"distance your sight, restrain yourself."
"The spear of a hothead flies past,"
but a fine mover has his path smoothed.
A man who worries all day long
will never be allowed a good moment.
A man who lazes all day long
will never have a solid house.
"A shot filled is like an oar abandoned on the ground,"
"when another is taken,"
his heart has obeyed the wish 'if only I had'
Do not block the moment of a great man
do not constrain the desire of one who is laden down.
"Barriers from him arise against the one who disputes with him,"
there is release for the ka with the one who shows love for him.
"This is the gift of sustenance, this and the god."
What he loves is action for him.
"When the face is turned back to you, after a storm,"
"there follows peace before his ka,"
and barriers before the enemy.
Planting love brings sustenance.
Instruct the great in what is useful for him
"Foster his image in the sight of people,"
"cause his wisdom to fall in front of his lord,"
and there may be rewards for you too before his ka.
"The stomach of the loved will be content,"
"your back will be clothed by it,"
"his image will be over you for the life of your house,"
"Your noble, the one you love,"
he is alive by it.
"When he makes a good gesture, do not be silent."
This is indeed the guarantee of your love in the body of those who love you.
"See, it is the ka that loves to listen."
"If you play the son of a man of a council,"
"a messenger for pleasing the multitude,"
select the fringes of action.
"In speaking do not take sides,"
in case he speaks his opinion:
"'officials, he sets the case on that side',"
and your mistake is turned into judgement.
"If you show mercy on a past failure,"
incline to a man for his virtue.
"Pass over him, do not recall it,"
since he might stay silent for you on day one.
"If you are rich after your impoverishment,"
"and acquire property after lack of it,"
"in the city that you have known,"
"with awareness of what happened to you before,"
do not place your trust in your wealth.
"It came to you by the gifts of the god,"
"so you will not be behind another like you,"
but the same could happen to him
"Bend your back to your superior,"
"your overseer of the king's domain,"
"and your house will be fixed on its goods,"
your rewards in their place.
The man who struggles with the superior is an irritant.
You live as long as the superior is pleased with you.
The shoulder is not injured by being exposed.
"Do not seize the house of neighbours,"
"do not suppress anything close to you,"
it gives no results in anything.
Let him not speak ill of you before you have heard.
A troublemaker is a man with no mind.
"Whoever is known as a quarreller,"
there is trouble for the struggler in places near to him.
Do not have sex with a child woman
when you knew the approach to the water of its chest.
There is no cooling what is in his body.
Do not go mad on making the approach.
He is cool after damaging his heart.
"If you seek out the character of a friend,"
"do not make your own enquiries, go direct to him,"
make the case with him alone
to avoid suffering in his matter.
"Debate with him after a period of time,"
and try his heart in the matter of the case.
"If what he has seen come out through him,"
"and he does the matter that angers you about him,"
"or that makes him a friend,"
"do not seize the sight,"
"be collected, do not deluge him with words,"
"do not reply with a slight,"
do not react against him by destroying him.
His moment cannot fail to come.
No one can escape from what is fated for him.
Let your face be bright as long as you live.
Whoever leaves the store cannot enter.
It is the bread of sharing that causes envy.
A man with an empty stomach is a man to complain;
the opponent is born out of impoverishment.
Do not make him into someone to approach you.
Favour is the memory of a man
in the years after ruin.
Know your plumage and your property will last.
Do not be mean in your character towards your friends.
"They are his river field when it floods, more important than his riches."
They are the property of one for another.
The quality of a son of a someone is good for him;
good character will be remembered.
"Punish from the head, teach by character."
The force against a criminal will be a model example.
Any instance except for results
is what makes a moaner turn into an active opponent.
If you marry a good-time girl
"A joyful woman known to her town,"
"If she is wayward,"
"and revels in the moment,"
"do not reject her, but instead let her enjoy;"
joyfulness is what marks calm water.
If you heed these things that I have told you
all your conduct will move forward.
"Their holding true, that is their wealth."
The memory of them moves in the mouth of people
from the excellence of their phrasing.
"When every saying has been brought,"
it does not perish in this land forever.
"Doing it is a matter for goodness,"
the words of the officials follow it.
"This is the teaching of a man to speak to posterity,"
hearing it he becomes an attentive craftsman.
"It is good to speak to posterity, for it will hear it."
"If there good cases arise from the one who is the superior,"
"he will be eternally effective,"
all his wisdom will last forever.
The wise man nourishes his soul
by establishing his goodness with it on earth.
"The wise man is famed for what he has learned,"
it is the official who is after good conduct.
"from the action of his heart and his tongue,"
"his lips are reliable when he is speaking,"
"and his eyes in seeing,"
his ears intent in hearing what is useful for his son.
"Who does what is right, is free from falsehood."
"Hearing is good for a son who hears,"
hearing enters into the hearer.
The hearer becomes one who is heard.
"Hearing is good, as speech is good."
The hearer is the master of what is useful.
"Hearing is good for the hearer,"
hearing is better than any other thing;
love of good comes into being.
How beautiful it is when a son receives what his father says.
Old age is achieved for him by it.
The hearer is one whom the god loves.
The one whom god hates does not hear.
The heart is the creator of its master.
Do not hear from the one who does not hear.
"A man's heart is his life, prosperity and health."
"It is the hearer who hears the speaker,"
the one who acts according to what is said is the one who loves hearing.
How good when a a son listens to his father.
How joyful is the one to whom this is said.
A son who is handsome is a hearing lord.
The hearer to whom it is said is effective in the body.
"Memory of him is in the mouth of the people,"
"Those who are on earth, and those who will be."
"If the son of a someone receives what his father says,"
There can be no wavering for any of his plans.
"Instruct your son to be a good hearer,"
"who will be excellent in the hearts of the officials,"
"guiding his mouth according to what he has been told,"
seen as a hearer.
"The son who excels, his steps are distinguished,"
but there is no straight way in for the one who fails to hear.
"The morning of the wise man will be his security,"
while the fool is pressed down.
"As for the fool unable to hear,"
nothing can ever be done for him.
"He sees wisdom as ignorance,"
and what is good as what is painful.
"He commits every error,"
to be accused of it each day.
"He lives on what one dies of,"
corrupt speech is his food.
"His character in this is well-known to the officials,"
saying 'living death' each day.
His faults are passed over
from the sheer number of faults on him each day.
A son who hears is a follower of Horus
It is good for him after he hears.
In his old age he achieves revered status.
"He can tell the same to his children,"
renewing the teaching of his father.
Every man teaches by his deeds.
"He tells on to the children,"
and they can tell their children.
"Show character, do not pass on your weaknesses."
"Securing what is right, is the life of your children"
"As for the principal who arrives with wrongdoing,"
people say what they see
'that is exactly how that man is'
to say to those who will hear
'that is exactly how that man is' too.
"There everyone sees, and the multitude is pacified."
There is no profit in riches without them.
"Do not remove a word, do not add it."
Do not put one in place of another.
Fight against opening up the bonds on you.
Guard against a man of experience saying
"'listen up, if you wish to be secure"
in the mouth of those who hear;
"wj=k aq.n=k m sp n Hmww
speak up when you have penetrated the case of the craftsman'."
"You speak at the case of closure,"
and all your plans will fall into place.
"Flood your heart, restrain your mouth"
then your plans will be among the officials.
Be straight in character before your lord.
"Do as he has said, that is the son,"
so those who hear it say
'indeed favour gave birth to him'.
"Say things of distinction,"
so the officials who hear may say
'how perfect is the issue of his mouth'.
Do as your master has said for you.
How good is one instructed by his father
"when he emerged from him out of his body,"
"and he told him, while he was in the body, entirely,"
May what he has done be greater than what he was told.
"See, a good son, by the gift of the god,"
surpassing what he was told before his lord.
He does what is right.
His heart has acted according to his set steps.
"As you reach me, your body intact,"
"the king content with everything,"
take years of life.
What I have done on earth is not little.
I took 110 years of life
"by the grant of the king to me,"
"favour ahead of the ancestors,"
from doing what is right for the king until the stage of revered status.
"This is its completion, from beginning to end as found in writing."
<1> Instruction of
"<4> the leader of the city and vizier Ptahhotep,"
"<5> under the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Isesi (may
he live forever until eternity!)."
<6> The leader of the city and vizier Ptahhotep says:
"<7> 'Sovereign, my lord,"
"<8> infirmity has developed, old age has befallen,"
"<9> feebleness has come, weakness is renewed."
<10> One sleeps as a child every day.
"<11> The eyes are weak, the ears have become deaf."
<12> Strength is waning through the tiredness of my heart.
<13> The mouth is silent and cannot speak.
<16> The mind has stopped and cannot remember the day before.
<17> The bones hurt because of the high age.
<18> Good has turned into evil.
<19> All taste has gone.
<20> What old age does to people
<21> is evil in every respect.
"<22> The nose is blocked and cannot breathe,"
<23> because of the difficulty of standing and sitting.
"<28> May this humble servant be ordered to appoint a staff-of-old-age,"
<30> so that I may tell him the words of those who have heard
<31> the counsels of the ancestors
<32> who once listened to the gods.
"<33> May the same be done for you,"
"<34> may suffering be driven away from the people,"
<35> and may the Two Banks serve you!'
<36> And the majesty of this god said:
"<37> 'Instruct him in the words of the past,"
<39> so that he will be a model for the children of officials.
"<40> May hearing enter him, and all sincerity<note>Exact meaning is

"Speak to him,"

"Gold Horus: Who wears the crown, who placates the gods;"
"given life like Re forever [and ever],"

"of Ptah, south of his wall, lord of [Ankh-tawi],"

"for whose creation the souls of Heliopolis assembled,"
"to act as king of eternity, a Horus who endures forever,"
"a good ruler, who does what is beneficial to (his) father and all
gods."
"He has restored what was in ruins,"
as monuments of eternal age.
He has dispelled injustice throughout the Two Lands
and justice was established [in its place].
"He lets falsehood be an abomination,"
and the land as in its primordial time.
"Now, when His Majesty arose as king,"
"<6> the temples of the gods and goddesses,"
"from Elephantine [to] the lagoons of the Delta,"
<7> Their shrines had fallen into decay
"Their sanctuaries were as if they had never existed,"
their temples were foot paths.
"The land was in distress,"
the gods were turning away from this land.
If [an army was] sent to Palestine
"to widen the borders of Egypt,"
no success of theirs came about <9> at all.
"If one prayed to a god to ask a thing of him,"
he wouldn't come [at all].
"Similarly, if one prayed to any goddess,"
she wouldn't come at all.
Their hearts were weak in their bodies.
They destroyed what had been built.
"After (some) days had passed after this,"
[His Majesty] appeared on the throne of (his) father
and he ruled the banks of Horus.
"The black land and the red land were under his dominion,"
and every land was bowing <11> to his might.
"Now, His Majesty was in his palace, which is in the House of
Aakheperkare,"
"like Re in heaven,"
and His Majesty was executing the plans of this land
and the governing of the Two Banks.
"Then His Majesty took <12> counsel with his heart,"
"seeking every excellent deed,"
"searching what was beneficial to (his) father Amun,"
fashioning his noble image of real electrum.
He surpassed what had been done before.
"He fashioned <13> (his) father Amun on thirteen carrying poles,"
"his sacred image being of electrum, lapis lazuli, [turquoise],"
"and every kind of precious stone,"
"whereas formerly the majesty of this noble god had been on eleven
carrying poles."
"He fashioned Ptah, south of his wall, lord of Ankh-tawi,"
"his noble image being of electrum, on eleven carrying poles,"
"his sacred image being of electrum, lapis lazuli, turquoise,"
"and every kind of precious stone,"
"whereas formerly the majesty of this noble god had been on [seven]
carrying poles."
"And His Majesty built monuments for the gods,"
"[fashioning] their statues of real electrum,"
"from the best of the foreign lands,"
building their sanctuaries anew
"as monuments of eternal age,"
"endowed with property forever,"
"setting aside offerings for them as daily sacrifices,"
providing their sacrificial bread on earth.
"He surpassed <17> what had been before,"
"he outdid what had been done since the time of the ancestors,"
"he initiated priests and prophets,"
"children of officials from their towns,"
sons of noted men whose names were well-known.
"<18> He multiplied their [alters] with gold, silver, bronze and
copper,"
without limit of [anything].
"He filled their workhouses with male and female slaves,"
brought as booty of His Majesty.
"<19> All [tributes] to the temples were [increased],"
"doubled, trebled and quadrupled,"
"with silver, gold, lapis lazuli, turquoise"
"and every kind of precious stone,"
"royal linen, white cloth, fine linen, moringa oil,"
"resin, fat,"
without limit of any good thing.
His Majesty (l.p.h.!) has hewn their barques
"on the river, from fresh cedar from Lebanon,"
"the pick of Negau,"
"plated with gold from the best of the foreign lands,"
so that they may illumine the river.
"His Majesty (l.p.h.!) has consecrated male and female slaves,"
and female singers and dancers
"<22> who had been maidservants<note>Uncertain.</note> in the palace,"
and their wages were charged to the palace
and to [the treasury] of the lord of the Two Lands.
"'I let them be guarded and protected for my forefathers,"
"all the gods,"
"<23> in order to placate them,"
"doing what their spirits like,"
so that they may protect Egypt.'
"The gods and goddesses who are in this land,"
"their hearts are in joy,"
"the lords of sanctuaries <24> are jubilating,"
"the banks are cheering and exulting,"
"jubilation is throughout the [entire] land,"
since a good [state] has come into being.
"The ennead in the Great Temple,"
"their arms are raised in adoration,"
their hands are full of Sed-festivals [of] <25> all eternity.
"All life and dominion with them are at the nostrils of the strong
king,"
"Horus who repeats birth,"

A wonder that happened to His Majesty;
one came to tell His Majesty:
'There are wild bulls on the hills of the district of Shetep.'
His Majesty sailed north
in the barque 'appearing in truth'
"in the evening,"
"starting a good journey,"
and arriving safely at the district of Shetep
in the morning.
"His Majesty appeared on a chariot,"
while his complete expedition was behind him.
"The officials and the soldiers of the whole expedition in its entirety
and the children of Kep were instructed"
to watch over these wild bulls.
His Majesty commanded that these bulls be driven
into a walled enclosure with a ditch.
"Then His Majesty ordered to attack these wild bulls,"
the total number thereof was 170 bulls.
"The number brought by His Majesty from the hunt on this day was 56
bulls."
"His Majesty tarried four days,"
as his horses hadn't been rested yet.
"Then His Majesty appeared on a chariot,"
and the number of these bulls brought by him from the hunt: 40 bulls.
Total: 96 bulls.

Marvel brought to His Majesty (l.p.h.!):

<10> and 317 women of her harem.
"<1> Year 11, third month of the Season of Inundation, day 1,"

His Majesty ordered the creation of a lake
"for the great wife of the king, <7> Tiy"
"(may she live!),"
"in her town of Djaru<8>kha,"
its length being 3700 cubits and its width 600 cubits.
His Majesty celebrated the feast of the opening of the lakes
"<10> in the third month of the Season of Inundation, day 16,"
when His Majesty was rowed <11> on it in the barque 'Aton gleams'.
"O living who are on earth,"

"as you wish that your city gods praise you,"
"that you remain at your places,"
"that you pass on your offices to your children,"
"that you arrive safely,"
"that you recount your expeditions to your wives,"
so you say:
"'A royal offering of Osiris,"

May he give
"a thousand loaves of bread,"
"a thousand jars of beer,"
"a thousand oxen,"

"Sebek-hotep,"
"justified,"

"There will not be a loss of your tomb-equipment,"
and it is not difficult for the mouth of him who says this.
"As to him who will do what I say,"

"<3> Year 16, third month of the Season of Growing."
His Majesty established the southern border at Heh.
<4>I established my border further south than my forefathers.
I added to what was bequeathed to me.
I am a king who speaks and acts.
"I make happen what I conceive,"
"eager to seize,"
"hasty to <7> succeed,"
"in whose heart a matter doesn't slumber,"
"anticipating inferiors,"
"suppressing mercy,"
"merciless to the enemy who attacks him,"
"who attacks one who would attack,"
"who is silent when one is silent,"
<9> who replies to a matter as befits it.
For to be idle after an attack
is to strengthen the heart of the enemy.
Aggression is valour
and retreat is cowardice.
Who is driven from his border is truly a coward.
For the Nubian listens to the word of mouth.
Answering him is making him retreat.
"If one acts aggressively towards him, he turns his back."
Retreat and he will take occasion to act aggressively.
<13> For they are not respectable people.
They are wretches with broken spirits.
My Majesty has seen them;
it is no lie.
"I captured their women,"
"I carried off <15> their underlings,"
"went to their wells,"
"drove off their bulls,"
"tore out their barley,"
<16> set fire to it.
"As my father lives for me,"
"I speak truthfully,"
there is no boast
that comes from my mouth.
As for any son of mine
"who shall maintain this border that My Majesty established,"
"he is my son, born to My Majesty."
"It befits a son that he be the champion of his father,"
<19> and maintains the border of his begetter.
"As to him who shall lose it,"
"who shall not fight <20> for it,"
"he is not my son,"
he was not born to me.
"Now, My Majesty had a statue of My Majesty made"
"at this border that My Majesty established,"
so that you may be persistent at it
and that you may fight for it.

I have made contracts for payments
to the priests of Abydos.
"I acted as Loving Son,"
"in the service of the House of Gold,"
in the mystery of the lord of Abydos.
I directed the works on the Neshmet-barque
and fashioned its cordage.
I conducted the Haker-ceremony for its lord
and the procession of Upwawet.
"I made all festival offerings for him,"
and recited to the priests.
"I equipped the god with his regalia,"
in my function of initiated
and my duty of clothing priest.
It is I who presented the hands
"in adorning the god,"

"so that I might be a follower of the god,"
in order to be glorious and mighty

Join with Your Majesty in your hearts!
"He is wisdom in the hearts,"
his eyes see after every body.
"He is Re by whose rays one sees,"
"who illumines the Two Lands more than the sun,"
who makes the land verdant more than a great Nile flood.
He has filled the Two Lands with life force.
"Noses turn cold when he starts to rage,"
he is at peace to let one breathe air.
"He gives food to those who are in his following,"
he nourishes who is loyal to him.
"The king is sustenance,"
"his mouth is abundance,"
who will be is his creation.
"He is Khnum of everybody,"

"He is Bastet who protects the Two Lands,"
who worships him will be protected by his arm.
"He is Sakhmet to who defies his command,"

"Fight for his name,"
"respect his oath,"
and you will be free of disloyalty.

"and the prow rope has been thrown <5> on land,"
"praise is given, and the god is thanked,"

"<7> and our crew has come back safe,"
without <8> loss to our expedition.
We reached <9> the end of Wawat
"and passed <10> Biga,"
and now we have come back <11> safely.
"Our land, we have reached it!"
"<12> Listen to me, count!"
I am free <13> from exaggeration.

"The utterance of a man <18> saves him,"

"<20> You do as you wish,"
it is tiresome to speak to you.
"I shall recount <22> to you something similar, which happened to me myself."
I had set off for the mining region of the sovereign
and I had gone to sea
in a boat <26> 120 cubits long
"and 40 cubits wide,"
with 120 sailors <28> of the pick of Egypt.
"Whether they looked <29> at the sky or looked at the land,"
they were more courageous than lions.
They could foretell a gale before it came
and a thunderstorm before it happened.
A gale came up <33> while we were at sea
before <34> we had reached land.
"The wind rose <35> and rose again,"
and a wave <36> with it of 8 cubits.
It was a beam that broke <37> it for me.
"Then the boat <38> sank,"
and of those aboard none remained.
Then I was cast <40> on an island
by a wave of the sea.
"I spent three days alone,"
"<42> my heart being my companion,"
and I slept in a shelter <44> of wood
embracing the shadows.
Then I stretched my legs
to learn what I might put in my mouth.
"<47> I found figs and grapes there,"
"and all kinds of fine vegetables,"
"<49> unripe sycamore figs were there as well as ripe ones,"
"<50> and muskmelon as if cultivated,"
"fish <51> were there as well as fowl,"
there was nothing <52> that was not on it.
"Then <53> I ate my fill,"
and dropped on the floor <54> because of the abundance on my arms.
"I took a fire drill, <55> made fire,"
and made <56> a burnt offering to the gods.
Then I heard <57> thunder.
"I thought it was a wave <59> of the sea,"
"trees were breaking, <60> the earth was trembling."
"When I uncovered <61> my face,"
I found it was a serpent coming.
"He measured <63> 30 cubits,"
"his beard was bigger <64> than 2 cubits,"
"his skin was gilded,"
his eyebrows were of real lapis lazuli.
He was bent up.
"<67> He opened his mouth to me,"
while I was <68> on my belly before him.
<69> He said to me:
"&quot;Who brought you, who brought you, young man?"
<70> Who brought you?
"If you delay telling me who brought you to this island,"
"<72> I will make you know yourself to be ashes,"
<73> turned into something that one can't see.&quot;
&quot;You speak to me
but I'm not hearing <75> it.
I am before you <76> and do not know myself.&quot;
"Then he put me <77> in his mouth,"
"took me to the place where he lived,"
and set me down without harming me.
"I was uninjured, without force applied to me."
"<81> He opened his mouth to me,"
while I was <82> on my belly before him.
<83> He then said to me:
"&quot;Who brought you, who brought you, <84> young man?"
"Who brought you to his island <85> in the sea,"
with water on all sides?&quot;
"Then I answered <87> this to him,"
"my arms bent <88> before him,"
I said to him:
<89> &quot;It's that I was going
<90> to the mining region on a mission <91> of the sovereign
in a boat <92> 120 cubits long
"and 40 cubits wide,"
with 120 sailors <94> of the pick of Egypt.
"<95> Whether they looked at the sky or looked at the land,"
<96> they were more courageous than lions.
They could foretell a gale <98> before it came
and a thunderstorm before it happened.
<99> Each one of them was more courageous <100> and stronger
than his fellow.
There was not <101> a fool among them.
A gale <102> came up while we were at sea
<103> before we had reached land.
"The wind rose and rose again,"
and a wave <105> with it of 8 cubits.
It was a beam that broke <106> it for me.
"Then the boat sank,"
<107> and of those aboard none remained <108> except myself
who is here with you.
<109> Then I was brought to this island
<110> by a wave of the sea.&quot;
<111> Then he said to me:
"&quot;Fear not, fear not, <112> young man!"
"Do not turn pale,"
<113> for you have reached me.
"Look, the god has let <114> you live"
and has brought you to this island of the spirit.
<115> There is nothing that is not on it
<116> and it is full of all good things.
<117> You will spend month upon <118> month
until you have completed four months <119> on this island.
Then <120> a boat will come from home
"<121> with sailors whom you know,"
<122> and you will go home with them
<123> and die in your city.
<124> How happy is he who can recount what he has experienced
when a painful thing has passed.
"<125> I will recount to you something similar,"
"which happened on this island,"
"<126> where I was with my relatives,"
including children.
We were 75 serpents in all with <128> my children and my relatives.
"I will not mention to you <129> the youngest daughter,"
whom I had obtained by prayer.
"Then a star <130> fell,"
and they went up in flames because of it.
It happened when I wasn't there --
<131> burnt when I wasn't among them!
Then I died for them
when I found <132> them as one heap of corpses.
"If you are brave, be stout-hearted,"
"<133> and you will embrace your children,"
"kiss <134> your wife,"
and see your house.
This is better than anything.
<135> You will reach home and remain there
<136> among your relatives.&quot;
"I was <137> stretched out on my belly,"
and touched <138> the ground before him.
I said to him:
"<139> &quot;I shall recount your might to the sovereign,"
"I shall make him aware <140> of your greatness,"
"I shall have them bring you ladanum, malabathrum,"
"<141> terebinth<note>Following Parkinson (1997).</note>, balsam,
processed incense"
<142> with which every god is pleased.
"I shall recount what has happened <143> to me,"
what I have seen of your might.
One will thank the god for you
<144> in the city before the council of the entire land.
"I shall slaughter <145> bulls for you as burnt offering,"
and strangle fowl for you.
I shall have boats brought for you
"laden <147> with all wealth of Egypt,"
as done for a god who loves <148> mankind
in a distant land that people do not know.&quot;
"<149> Then he laughed at me,"
"at what I had said,"
which was wrong to his heart.
<150> He said to me:
"&quot;You don't have much myrrh,"
or any form of incense.
"<151> But I am the ruler of Punt,"
myrrh is mine.
"<152> That malabathrum that you said would be brought,"
a large quantity is from this island.
"<153> Once it happens that you have left this place,"
"you will never see this island again,"
which will have become water.&quot;
"Then that boat <155> came,"
as he had foretold previously.
Then I went
<156> and put myself up a tall tree
and I recognized those who were aboard.
<157> Then I went to report this
and found that he knew it.
<158> Then he said to me:
"&quot;Fare well, fare well, young man,"
"to your house, and see <159> your children!"
Let my name be good in your city.
This is my due from you.&quot;
"<161> Then I placed myself on my belly,"
my arms bent before him.
<162> Then he gave me a cargo
"of myrrh, malabathrum,"
"terebinth<note>Following Parkinson (1997).</note>, <163> balsam,
camphor,"
"<al>SAasx</al>-plants, black eye-paint,"
"giraffe tails,"
"a great lump of incense,"
"elephant tusks,"
"hounds, guenons, apes,"
and all kinds of riches.
"<166> Then I loaded this onto the boat,"
and it happened that I placed myself on my belly
<167> to thank the god for him.
Then he said to me:
"&quot;You will reach home <168> within two months,"
"you will embrace your children,"
"you will become rejuvenated <169> at home,"
and will be buried.&quot;
Then I went down to the shore <170> near this boat.
Then I called to the expedition <171> that was on this boat.
"I gave praise on the shore to the lord of this island,"
<172> and those who were aboard did the same.
Then we sailed north
"<173> to the residence of the sovereign,"
"and reached the residence <174> within two months,"
like everything he had said.
"Then I entered before the sovereign,"
<175> and presented him with this tribute
that I had brought from within this island.
<176> Then he thanked the god for me
before the council of the entire land.
<177> Then I was appointed as follower
<178> and was endowed with <179> his people.
"See me having reached land,"
having <181> viewed what I have experienced.
"Listen <182> to my speech,"
as it is good to listen to people!'
<183> Then he said to me:
"'Don't act clever, <184> friend!"
Who would give water <185> to a goose
when the day dawns of his slaughter in the morning?'

<r23> &quot;It is Sehotepibre who has gone to the horizon.&quot;
"It is unknown why this happened,"
but I was deceived. <@27d>
it was reported to me.
My heart became tormented<@22>. <@28c>

"[he will] conquer southern lands,"

"He placed me at the head of his tribe<@36>, <@40f>"
"from the pick of what was his<@37>, <@40i>"

"This humble servant entrusts his chicks,"
"begotten by him in this place,"

"o sovereign (l.p.h.!), our lord?<@139>&quot; "
"<v55> Now, they had brought their menits and their sistr<@140>a <@76m>"

and presented them to His Majesty (l.p.h.!).
<@141>Then they said to His Majesty (l.p.h.!)<@142>: <@77c>

"one whom we name 'son of the north wind',"
born <v59> [in Egypt!]
"The flight was made through terror of you,"
he turned away from this land through [fear] of you.
"A face will not scheme<note>Passage probably corrupt.</note> at [the

"&quot;You will not fear<@147>, <@79e>"
"<@0>Now, I was standing by and heard his voice,"
"<2> and as he spoke I was close to a conspiracy<note>Consistent with
note 1 of Davies (1975).</note>."
"My heart fluttered, <3> my arms dropped, and trembling befell every
limb."
I stole away leaping to find myself a hiding-place.
I placed <5> myself between two bushes
to clear the road for its traveller.
<@1>I then went south;
"I did not intend to come to this residence,"
since I expected there would be contention
that I didn't think I would survive<@2>. <@13d>
<8><@3> I crossed Maati
"in the vicinity of the Sycamore,"
<9> and I arrived on the Island of Snofru.
"I spent the day at the edge of <10> a field,"
and departed early the next day.
I met a man standing <11> on the road
"and he saluted me, one who feared him."
"After it had become <12> dinner time,"
I reached the port of Negau.
"I crossed in a boat without a rudder,"
<14> by means of the west wind.
"<@4>I passed east of the quarry <15> above the Mistress of the Red
Mountain."
Then I made <16> my way northward.
"I reached <17> the Walls of the Ruler,"
<@6>made to restrain the bedouin<@5>. <@17d>
"I crouched down in a bush,"
for fear of being seen by
the guards in the settlement who were on duty.
<@7>I travelled <20> during the night
and the next morning I reached Peten.
<21> I halted on an island of Kemur.
An attack of thirst <22> overtook me;
I was parched and my throat was dry.
<23><@8> I thought: &quot;This is the taste of death.&quot;
I lifted my heart and collected myself
when I heard the sound of bellowing of cattle
<@9>and caught sight of bedouin.
"Their leader, who had been in Egypt, recognized me."
He gave me water and boiled milk for me.
I went <28> with him to his tribe
and what they did was good.
<@10>Land gave me to <29> land.
I departed from Byblos
and returned to Qedem.
<@11>I had spent <30> a year and a half there
"when Amunenshi fetched me,"
who was ruler <31> of Upper Retjenu.
He said to me:
"&quot;You will be happy with me,"
<@12>for you'll hear the language <32> of Egypt.&quot;
He said this because he knew my character
"and had heard <33> of my experience,"
for the Egyptians who were there with him had borne witness to me.
Then he said to me:
&quot;Why is it that you have come here?
Has anything happened in <36> the residence?<@13>&quot;
<@14>&quot;The king of Upper and Lower Egypt
Sehotepibre has gone to the horizon.
<37> The circumstances of it are unknown.&quot;
But I fabricated:
"<38> &quot;When I had returned from an expedition (to) the land of the
Libyans,"
it was reported to me.
My mind <39> became weak
<@15>and my heart was not in my body.
"It brought me to the ways of flight,"
"although I was not talked about,"
"<@16>my face was not spat on,"
"<@17>a reproach was not heard,"
and my name was not heard from the mouth <42> of a herald.
I do not know what brought me to this land;
<43> it is like a plan of god.<@18>&quot; <@29f>
"<@19>&quot;How will that land be without him,"
"that excellent god,"
"fear of whom was throughout <45> the lands,"
like of Sekhmet in a year of pestilence?&quot;
"I said to him, <46> answering him:"
<@20>&quot;His son has already entered the palace
and has assumed the inheritance of his father.
"Now, he is a god without equal,"
<48> there is no other before him.
"He is possessor of wisdom,"
"excellent <49> of plans, effective of orders,"
coming and going are by <50> his command.
"It was he who subjugated the foreign lands,"
"while his father was within his palace,"
<51> and he reported what he had ordered to be done.
"<@21>Now, he is a hero <52> who acts with his own arm,"
a champion without equal
when he is seen attacking barbarians
and approaching combat.
<54> He is one who bends down horns
"and weakens hands,"
so that his enemy cannot marshal troops.
"He is vengeful, one who smashes heads."
One cannot stand <56> near him.
He is far-striding when he annihilates the fugitive.
<57><@22> There is no good end for him who shows him his back.
He is steadfast at the moment of forcing retreat.
He is one who disables without showing his back.
He is stout-hearted <59> when he sees multitudes.
He doesn't let laziness near his heart.
<60> He is eager when he sees the east.
"<@23>His joy is his attacking barbarians,"
as he clasps his shield he strikes down.
"He doesn't repeat the slaying,"
"<@24>as there is no one who escapes his arrow,"
and no one who draws his bow.
"The barbarians flee from his arms,"
as <64> from the might of the Great One.
"He fights having foreseen the outcome,"
heedless of all else.
"<@25>He is beloved, great of charm,"
"<66> he has conquered through love,"
"his city loves him more than itself,"
it rejoices over him more than over its god.
"Men and women pass by, cheering him."
"He is a king who conquered in the egg,"
<69> he was dedicated since he was born.
He is one who makes those born with him plentiful.
<70> He is the unique gift of god.
How joyful is this land that he rules!
"<71><@26> He is one who extends borders,"
"he will conquer southern lands,"
"not considering the northern lands,"
"<@27>as he was made to smite the Asiatics <73> and trample the
bedouin."
"Go down to him and let him know your name,"
as someone far from His Majesty who inquires<@28>. <@39f>
<@29>He will not fail to do good to a foreign land
that will be loyal to him.&quot;
Then he said to me:
"&quot;But then Egypt is happy, since it knows his ability."
"<77> You are here, and you will stay with me."
What I shall do for you is good.&quot;
"<78> He placed me at the head of his children,"
<@30>and he married me to his eldest daughter.
"He let me choose for myself of his land,"
"<80> from the pick of what was his,"
<@31>on his border with <81> another land.
"It was a good land, called Araru<@32>. <@41c>"
"<@33>Figs <82> were in it, and grapes."
It had more wine than water.
Its honey was plentiful and its moringa oil was abundant.
Every kind of fruit was on its trees.
"<84> Barley was there, and emmer."
There was no limit to all kinds of cattle.
<@34>Much came to me because of the love of me.
He made me the ruler of a tribe
of the finest <87> of his land.
"Provisions were made for me consisting of daily fare,"
"<@35>a daily supply of wine,"
"cooked meat, roast fowl, as well as desert game."
One would snare for me
"and lay it out for me,"
in addition to the catch of my hounds.
they made for me
"I spent many years,"
"while my children became strong,"
each man controlling <94> his tribe.
A messenger who came north or went south to the residence
<95> tarried for me;
I let everyone tarry.
"<96><@36> I gave water to the thirsty,"
"I showed the way to the stray,"
and I rescued the robbed.
"<@37>The bedouin <98> who were preparing to fight and to oppose the
rulers of the lands,"
<99> I countered their movements.
This ruler of <100> Retjenu
let me spend many years
as commander <101> of his army.
Every land against which I advanced
"I defeated,"
it being driven from its pastures and wells.
"<103> I seized its cattle,"
"I carried off its inhabitants,"
<104> and took away their food.
<@38>I slew its people
"<105> with my arm, with my bow,"
"<@39>with my movements,"
and with <106> my excellent plans.
"In his heart I was beneficial,"
<107> and he loved me for he knew that I was valiant.
He placed me
"<108> at the head of his children,"
<@40>for he had seen my arms were proficient.
There came a strong man of Retjenu
to challenge me in my tent;
<@41>he was a hero without equal
and he had entirely annihilated it.
He said he would fight with me.
"<@42>He intended <112> to rob me,"
planning to seize my cattle
<113><@43> on the advice of his tribe.
That ruler conferred <114> with me.
"I said: &quot;I do not know him,"
I am not his companion
<115> that I could walk freely in his camp.
Is it the case that I have opened his hurdle
or climbed over his walls?
It is resentment
because he sees me carrying out his affairs.
"<@44>I have become like a bull of cattle in the midst of <119> other
cows,"
"whom the bull of the herd attacks,"
<120> whom the longhorn is charging.
Is an insignificant man <121> loved as a superior?
There is no barbarian who associates <122> with a marsh-dweller.
What can papyrus achieve on a mountain?
<123> Does a bull want to fight
"or does the fighting bull want to sound the retreat for fear of being
equalled?"
"<125> If it is his wish to fight,"
let him express his desire.
"<126> Is a god ignorant of what he has ordained,"
or does he know what the situation is?&quot;
"At night, I strung my bow, shot <128> my arrows,"
"sharpened my dagger,"
and polished my weapons.
"When the day dawned, Retjenu had come."
<130> It had assembled its tribes
"and had gathered its neighbouring lands,"
planning this battle<@45>. <@50c>
"Every heart burned for me,"
"wives were jabbering,"
"and every heart was sorry for me,"
thinking:
<@46>&quot;Is there another <134> hero who could fight him?&quot;
"Then his shield, his axe,"
<135> and an armful of his spears came down.
"After I had made his weapons miss,"
I let his arrows pass by me
"<@47>to no effect,"
one close to the other<@48>. <@51e>
"When he approached <138> me,"
"I shot him,"
and my arrow was stuck in his neck.
He cried out and fell on his face.
I slew him with his axe
"and uttered my war-cry <141> on his back,"
<@49>while every Asiatic was shouting.
"I gave praise <142> to Month,"
"whose supporters celebrated a triumph through him.<note>Following note
3 of Davies (1975).</note>"
This ruler Amunenshi
took me in his arms<@50>. <@52g>
<@51>Then I carried off his property
and seized his cattle.
What he had planned to do to me
I did to him.
I took what was in his tent
<146> and despoiled his encampment.
"With this I became great,"
"grew wealthy in <147> goods,"
<@52>and grew rich in cattle;
thus the god acted to be merciful
"to one with whom he had been angry,"
<@53>one whom he had led astray to <149> another land.
Today his heart is glad.
"A fugitive flees <150> because of his environment,"
while my fame is in the residence.
"<151> A creeping man creeps because of hunger,"
<@54>while I give bread to my neighbour.
"A man leaves his land because of nakedness,"
<153><@55> while I have white and fine linen.
"<154> A man runs because of the lack of someone to send,"
while I have <155> many servants.
"My house is fine, my grounds are extensive,"
<156> and memory of me is in the palace.
"<@56>All the gods who ordained this flight,"
may you be merciful and bring me home. <@55g>
Perhaps you will let me to see the place where my heart dwells.
<159> What matters more than my corpse being buried
in the land where I was born?
"<@57>This is a call for help,"
"that a good event may occur,"
that the god may give me grace.
"May he act as to make well the end of one whom he had grieved,"
<162> as his heart feels pity for one whom he had compelled
to live in a foreign land.
Is it today <163> that he is so gracious
"as to hear the prayer from afar,"
and as to exchange the region where he had roamed the earth
for the place from which he had brought him away?
"<165><@58> May the king of Egypt be merciful to me,"
that I may live by his mercy!
<166> May I greet the mistress of the land who is in his palace!
May I hear the messages of her children!
"Then my body will become young again,"
"for old age has come,"
"weakness <169> has overtaken me,"
"my eyes are heavy,"
"my arms are weak,"
"<170> my legs have ceased to follow,"
"the heart is weary,"
and I am near <171> to passing away<@59>. <@58b>
May they lead me to the cities of eternity!
May I follow <172> the Mistress of All!
Then she will tell me that her children are well.
May she pass eternity above me!
"Now, the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Kheperkare,
justified, was tol<@60>d <@58h>"
"about this state in which I was,"
<@61>and His Majesty sent a message <175> to me
"with royal gifts,"
"to gladden the heart of this humble servant,"
<@62>like that of a ruler of any land.
The king's children who were in his palace
<@63>had <177> me hear their messages.
<178> Copy of the decree brought to this humble servant
concerning his being brought back to Egypt:
<179> &quot;Horus: Living of birth;
Two Ladies: Living of birth<@64>; <@59k>
<@65>The king of Upper and Lower Egypt: Kheperkare;
Son of Re:
"<180> Amenemhet, may he live forever until eternity."
Royal decree to follower Sinuhe.
"<181> This decree of the king is brought to you,"
"to let you know that your roving through lands,"
"<182> having gone from Qedem to Retjenu,"
"<@66>land giving you to land,"
was at the counsel <183> of your heart to you.
<@67>What have you done that one should act against you?
"You have not cursed that one should reprove your speech<@68>, <@60f>"
<184> and you have not spoken in the council of officials
that one should oppose your utterances.
"<185><@69> This idea carried away your heart,"
but it was not in the heart against you.
"This heaven of yours, who is in the palace,"
"<186> endures and prospers to this day,"
"her head is covered with the kingship of the land,"
<@70>and her children are in the cabinet.
"You will accumulate precious things that they will give to you,"
and live on their gifts.
"<188><@71> Return to Egypt,"
"and you will see the residence where you grew up,"
"you will kiss the ground at <189> the great double gate,"
and you will join the companions.
"For now you have begun to grow old,"
you have lost virility.
Think of the day <191> of burial
<@72>and passing to blessedness.
To you will be assigned a night with oils
<192> and wrappings from the hands of Tayet.
A funeral procession will be held for you
"on the day <193> of burial,"
with a mummy sheath of gold
"<@73>and a mask of lapis lazuli,"
"heaven above you,"
"you having been placed in <194> a hearse,"
"oxen dragging you,"
<@74>musicians preceding you.
The dance of the inert ones will be performed
"<@75>at the entrance of your tomb,"
"the requisites for a mortuary offering will be recited for you,"
one will slaughter at the entrance of your altar.
Your pillars will be built of limestone
in the midst of those of <197> the king's children.
<@76>You will never die in a foreign land
and Asiatics will not bury you.
You will not be put in the skin of a ram
when your grave is made.
It has been a long time of roaming <199> the earth.
Mind the dead body and return!&quot;
<@77>This decree reached me
as I was standing in <200> the middle of my tribe.
"When it had been read to me,"
"<@78>I placed myself on my belly,"
I touched the earth
and strewed it over my chest.
"<@79>I went around my encampment cheering, <202> saying:"
&quot;How can this be done for a servant
whose heart led him astray to alien lands?
"<@80>So, good is the kindness"
that saves me from death!
<@81>Your spirit will let me reach <204> the end
with my body at home.&quot;
Copy of the reply to this decree:
&quot;Servant of the palace Sinuhe <205> says:
<@82>'In very good peace!
Concerning this flight
"<@83>that this humble servant made in his ignorance,"
"it is <206> your spirit, good god, lord of the Two Lands,"
"loved by Re<@84>, <@64h>"
"<@85>and praised by Month, lord of Thebes,"
"by Amun, <207> lord of the throne of the Two Lands,"
"by Sobek-Re,"
"<@86>Horus, Hathor<@87>, <@64m>"
"and Atum with his Ennead,"
"<208><@88> by Sopdu-Neferbau-Semseru, the eastern Horus<@89>, <@64p>"
by Nebet-imhet
"(may she enfold <209> your head!),"
"the divine council upon the flood,"
"Min-Horus in the midst of the lands,"
"<@90>Wereret, mistress <210> of Punt, Nut,"
"Harwerre,"
and all the gods of Egypt
<211> and the islands of the sea
"<@91>(may they give life and dominion to your nostrils,"
"endow you with their gifts,"
"<212> and give you eternity without limit,"
"forever without end,"
and may fear of you resound
"<213> in flat lands and mountainous lands,"
for you have subjugated what the sun revolves around;
"this is the prayer of this humble servant <214> to his lord,"
"who saves from the West),"
"<@92>lord of perception, perceiver of the people, who perceives"
<215> as the majesty of the palace
"what this humble servant was afraid to say.<note>Parenthetic eulogy
suggested by note 4 of Davies (1975).</note>"
It is like something too great <216> to recount.
"O great god, equal of Re"
in understanding one who serves him.
"This humble servant is in the hands of one who cares for him,"
placed under his guidance.
"<@93>Your Majesty <218> is conquering Horus,"
your arms are stronger than all lands.
"<219> Now, may Your Majesty command that he be made to bring"
"Meki from Qedem,"
"Khen<220>tiuash<note>Obscure name.</note> from the interior of Keshu,"
<@94>and Mino<@95>s <@66k>
"<221> from the two lands of Fenkhu<note>Mentioned in the dictionary of
Gardiner (1957).</note>."
"<@138>They are rulers whose names are well known,"
<222> who live by love of you.
"Without mentioning Retjenu,"
it is yours like <223> your hounds.
"<@96>This flight that the servant made,"
"it was not intended,"
"<@97>it was not in my heart,"
I did not devise it.
I don't know what separated me from the place.
"<@98>It was as <225> a dreaming state,"
"as if a marsh-dweller saw himself in <226> Elephantine,"
a man from the Delta in Taseti.
"There was no fear,"
"one didn't run after me,"
"<@99>I didn't hear a reproach,"
and my name was not heard <228> from the mouth of a herald.
"But, that shuddering of my body,"
"my feet <229> hastened,"
"<@100>my heart drove me,"
the god who ordained this flight
<230> dragged me away.
"I was not haughty before,"
<@101>as a man respects one whom his land knows.
"Re has put the fear of you throughout the land,"
and the dread of you in every foreign land.
"Whether I am at home or in this place,"
yours is what this horizon veils.
"The sun rises for your sake,"
"<@102>the water of the river is drunk <234> when you wish,"
and the air of heaven is breathed when you say so<@103>. <@68l>
"This humble servant will entrust <235> his chicks,"
"begotten by this humble servant in this place,"
<236> now that one has come to this humble servant.
May Your Majesty do as he wishes.
<@104>One lives on the breath that you give.
"<237> May Re, Horus and Hathor love"
"this noble nose of yours,"
"which Month, lord of Thebes, desires to live forever.' &quot;"
"<@105>I was allowed to spend a day in Araru,"
<239> transferring my property to my children.
"<@106>My eldest son was in charge of my tribe,"
"my tribe and all my property were in his hands,"
"all my serfs and my cattle,"
<@107>my fruit and each fruit tree of mine.
Then this humble servant came southward.
I halted at the Road of Horus<@108>. <@70bb>
The commander there in charge of the border patrol
"<243><@139> sent a message to the residence to let them know<@109>.
<@70e>"
Then His Majesty let
"<244> the excellent overseer of the peasants of the palace come,"
accompanied by laden ships
<245> bearing royal gifts
"for the bedouin who had come with me,"
leading me to the Road of Horus.
<246> I mentioned each one of them by his name<@110>. <@71c>
"Every servant was at his duty,"
"<@111>and when I set <247> sail,"
"there was kneading and straining beside me,"
until I reached the town of Usu.
"<248> And very early the next morning,"
"<@112>they came to call me,"
"ten men came and ten men <249> went,"
ushering me
to the palace.
"I touched the ground with my forehead between the sphinxes,"
<250><@113> as the king's children stood in the gateway to meet me.
The companions <251> who ushered to the audience hall
showed me the way to the cabinet.
"<252><@114> I found His Majesty on the great throne in the gateway of
electrum."
I was <253> stretched out on my bell<@140>y
and did not know myself before him.
"This god <254> addressed me kindly,"
but I was like a man seized in the dusk.
"<255><@115> My soul fainted,"
"my limbs failed,"
<@116>my heart was not in my body
that I could distinguish life from death<@117>. <@74e>
Then His Majesty said to one of these companions:
&quot;Raise him up
and let him speak to me!&quot;
And His Majesty said:
&quot;You have returned
after roaming foreign lands.
"Flight has taken its toll of you,"
"old man,"
<@118>you have reached old age.
It is no small matter that your corpse be buried
without your interment by barbarians<@119>. <@75c>
"Do not act against yourself, do not act against yourself anymore!"
You did not speak <260> when your name was pronounced.
You shouldn't be afraid of punishment!<@120>&quot; <@75g>
<@121>I answered this with the answer <261> of a frightened man:
&quot;What has my lord said to me?
"If I answer it,"
"it is not because of me,"
"<262> but it is the act of a god;<note>Following note 6 of Davies
(1975).</note>"
"it is that there is fright in my body,"
like that which caused the fated flight<@122>. <@75o>
"<263><@123> I am before you,"
"life is yours,"
may Your Majesty do as he wishes.&quot;
Then the king's children were ushered in
and His Majesty said to the royal wife:
<@124>&quot;Sinuhe <265> has returned as an Asiatic
raised by bedouin.&quot;
"Then she uttered a very great cry,"
<@125>and the king's children shrieked as one.
Then they said <267> to His Majesty:
"&quot;Is it not really him,"
"sovereign, my lord?&quot;"
<@126>And His Majesty said:
&quot;It is really him.&quot;
"Now, they had brought their menits, their sistra,"
<269><@127> and their naos sistra
"with them,"
and they presented them to His Majesty<@128>. <@77b>
"<@129>&quot;Your hands <270> upon something good,"
"enduring king,"
ornament of the mistress of heaven!
May the golden one give
<271> life to your nostrils
and may the mistress of the stars enfold you!
<@130>The crown of Upper Egypt travels north
"and the crown of Lower Egypt travels south,"
"joined and united by the word of Your Majesty,"
while the cobra is placed on your forehead.
"You have delivered the poor from evil,"
"so may Re, lord of the Two Lands, be gracious to you!"
"<274> Hail to you, as to the mistress of all!"
Slacken your bow
<@131>and lay down your arrow!
"<275> Give breath to him who is suffocating,"
"give us our beautiful gift<@132>, <@78e>"
"<276> this one who is named 'son of the north wind',"
the barbarian born in Egypt!
"<277> He took flight through fear of you,"
he left the land through <278> terror of you.
"A face will not pale at the sight of your face,"
<279> an eye that gazes at you will not fear.&quot;
<@133>And His Majesty said:
"&quot;He will not fear,"
<280><@134> he will not gibber with terror.
"He will be a companion among <281> the officials,"
and he will be included in the entourage.
<282> Proceed to the robing room to wait on him!&quot;
"Then I came out of <284> the cabinet,"
while the king's children were giving me their hands.
"<285> Afterwards, we went to the great double gate."
"<286> I was assigned to the house of a king's son,"
"in which there were precious things,"
"a bathroom, divine images of the horizon,"
"valuables <288> from the treasury,"
"clothes of royal linen, myrrh,"
<289> and fine oil of the king.
"Officials whom he loved were in every room,"
and every servant was at his duty.
Years were made to vanish from my body.
<291> I was clothed and my hair was combed.
"A reward was given <292> to the foreign land,"
and clothes to the bedouin.
"I was clothed <293> in fine linen,"
"was anointed with fine oils,"
and slept on a bed.
"I returned the sand to those who are upon it,"
<295> and the wood oil to those who are smeared with it.
"For me, (my) house and my garden were given back to the
owner,<note>Grammatical structure is problematic, and translation is
uncertain.</note>"
which had been in the hands of a companion.
Many craftsmen <297> rebuilt it
and all of its trees were planted anew.
Meals were brought to me
"from the palace three or four times a day,"
<299> in addition to what the king's children gave
without a moment of interruption.
A pyramid of stone was built for me
in the midst of the pyramids<@135>. <@80d>
The overseer of the masons of the pyramid
"took charge of <302> its ground-plan,"
"the overseer of the seal makers painted,"
"the sculptors <303> carved,"
and the overseer of workers in the necropolis
<304> concerned himself with it.
"<@136>All required equipment to be put in a tomb shaft was supplied
therein."
"Mortuary priests were given to me,"
"and a tomb garden was made for me,"
"with fields in front in the right place,"
<307><@137> as done for a chief companion.
"My image was overlaid <308> with gold,"
its kilt with electrum.
It is His Majesty who let this be done.
<309> There is no commoner for whom the like has been done.
I was in <310> the favour of the king
until the day of death came.'
<311> This was copied from start to finish as found in writing.
I was stretched out on my bell<@0>y <@73c>
"my limbs failed<@1>, <@74c>"
"a numerous army to the Libyan land<@0>, <@7c>"
<1> My pyramid of stone was built
in the vicinity of the pyramid
<@0>of the stonemasons.
The masons of the pyramid

"painters painted <3> in it,"

"The residence was in silence,"
"<9><@6> hearts were in mourning,"
"the great double gate was shut,"
"<10> courtiers were grieving,"
patricians <11> were wailing.
"<@7>Now, His Majesty had sent"
"an army <12> to the Libyan land,"
<@8>with his eldest son <13> in command;
the good god Sesostris
"had been sent <14> to smite the foreign lands,"
"to slay the inhabitants of Libya,"
"<15> and was now returning, having carried off captives <16> from
Libya"
and countless of all kinds of cattle.
<17> The companions of the palace sent a message
"to the western border,"
"to inform the king's son of the affair that had happened <19> in the
cabinet."
"The messengers found him on the road,"
<20> reaching him at nightfall.
He never hesitated at all
"and the falcon flew off with <22> his followers,"
without informing his army of it.
"<@9>Now, a message had been sent <23> to the king's children"

I lifted my heart and my body

<@15>Then I said to him<@16>: <@27a>

"<@18>as if a marsh-dweller saw himself <66> in Elephantine,"

<67> Then he said to me<@19>: <@30c>
and he reported to him what he ordered to be done.
<81> He is far-striding when he shoots the fugitive<@21>.
He is eager when he attacks <85> the easterners<@22>. <@35c>

"&quot;I speak to you, all people."
I will let you know the favours that were granted to me.
I have been rewarded with gold seven times
"before the entire land,"
and with male and female slaves as well.
I have been endowed with very many fields.
"The name of a brave man is in what he has done,"
without ever perishing in this land.&quot;
He says:
&quot;I grew up in the town of Nekheb.
My father was a soldier of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt
"Seqenenre, justified,"
"and was called Baba, son of Rainet."
"Then I became a soldier in his place,"
"on the ship 'The Wild Bull',"
"in the time of the lord of the Two Lands Nebpehtire, justified."
"<6> I was a young man, before I had married,"
and I slept in a hammock of net<note>Uncertain.</note>.
"After I had established a household,"
"I was taken <7> to the ship 'The Northern',"
because I was brave.
Then I followed the sovereign (l.p.h.!) on foot
after him riding on this chariot.
"When the town of Avaris was besieged,"
I showed valour on foot in His Majesty's presence.
"Then I was assigned to 'Rising in Memphis',"
and there was fighting on the water in Padjedku of Avaris.
Then I made a capture <10> and carried off a hand.
"When it was reported to the royal herald,"
I was given gold of valour.
"Then there was more fighting in this place,"
"again I made a capture <11> there and carried off a hand,"
and again I was given gold of valour.
"Then there was fighting in Egypt south of this town,"
<12> and I brought away a man as captive.
"I went down into the water,"
"for he was captured on the side of <13> the town,"
and crossed the water carrying him.
"When it was reported to the royal herald,"
I was rewarded with gold once more.
"Then Avaris was captured,"
and I brought booty from there:
"one man and three women, altogether four people."
And His Majesty gave them to me for slaves.
"Then Sharahen was besieged for three years,"
and His Majesty captured it.
Then I brought booty from there:
two women and a hand.
"I was given gold of valour,"
and I was given the captives for slaves.
"After His Majesty had slain the bedouin tribes of Asia,"
<17> he sailed southward to Khent-hen-nefer
"to destroy the Nubian nomads,"
and His Majesty carried out a large massacre among them.
<18> Then I brought booty from there:
two living men and three hands.
"I was rewarded with gold once more,"
and two female slaves were given to me.
"His Majesty sailed northward,"
"rejoicing in strength and victory,"
having captured southerners and northerners.
"Then Aata came to the south,"
<20> and his fate brought on his doom
when the gods of Upper Egypt grasped him.
"He was found by His Majesty at Tent-ta-o,"
and His Majesty brought him away <21> as captive
and all his people as booty.
Then I brought two warriors as captives from the ship of Aata.
I was given five people
"and five arourae of land in my town,"
and the same was done for the whole crew.
"Then that enemy called Tetian came,"
who had drawn together rebels.
His Majesty slew him
and his troop was annihilated.
Then I was given three people
and five arourae of land in my town.
"Then I conveyed the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Djeserkare,
justified,"
as he sailed southward to Kush
to widen <25> the borders of Egypt.
Then His Majesty smote that Nubian nomad
"in the midst of his army,"
"taken in a stranglehold,"
"none missing,"
the fleeing <26> were felled
as though they had never been.
"Now, I was in the van of our army,"
"where I fought properly,"
and His Majesty saw my valour.
"I carried off two hands,"
and presented them to His Majesty.
Then his people and his cattle were pursued.
I brought a captive and presented him to His Majesty.
"I brought His Majesty to Egypt from Upper Well in two days,"
and I was rewarded with gold.
"Then I brought away two female slaves as booty,"
in addition to those I had presented <29> to His Majesty.
Then I was appointed to be warrior-of-the-ruler.
"Then I conveyed the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Aakheperkare,
justified,"
"as he sailed southward to Khent-hen-nefer,"
"<30> to crush rebellion throughout the lands,"
and to drive off intrusion from the desert region.
"I showed valour in his presence at the cataract,"
during the towing <31> of the fleet through the eddy.
Then I was appointed to be naval commander.
<33> and His Majesty became as enraged as a panther.
His Majesty shot
and his first arrow stuck in the chest of that enemy.
"It was done there in an act of massacre,"
and their people were brought away as captives.
"<35> His Majesty sailed northward,"
all foreign lands in his grasp.
That wretched Nubian nomad hung with his head downward
from the prow of the falcon-ship of His Majesty.
One landed <36> at Karnak.
"Thereafter one proceeded to Retjenu,"
to vent his fury throughout the lands.
"When His Majesty reached Naharina,"
"<37> His Majesty (l.p.h.!) found that enemy marshalling troops,"
and His Majesty carried out a large massacre among them.
Countless were the captives
that His Majesty brought away from his victories.
"Now, I was in the van of our army,"
and His Majesty saw my valour.
"<39> I brought away a chariot, its horse,"
"and him who was on it as captive,"
and presented them to His Majesty.
I was rewarded with gold once more.
<40> I have grown old and reached old age.
I rest in the tomb that I myself built.

Then this priest said:

so that His Majesty might bring them to Thebes
"for his father Amun,"
every year.
"All things were entrusted to me under [the king of Upper and Lower
Egypt,"
"this good god,]"
<7> because he trusted me.
I was appointed as count and overseer of the storehouses.
The fields of the god's offerings were under my command.
All excellent works together were under my authority.
"I saw the great works that he built [in Karnak,"
"erecting the magnificent hall of papyrus columns,"
"erecting] <8> great pylons next to it,"
"from beautiful white limestone,"
"erecting the magnificent flagstaffs in front of the temple,"

<9> plated with electrum.
I saw erection of the great gate

the sacred figure thereon made from gold.
I saw erection of the two [great] obelisks
[in front of the temple from granite.]
"I saw <10> construction of a magnificent ship,"
"120 cubits long and 40 cubits wide,"
to ship these obelisks.
"They came in peace, safe and sound,"
and arrived in Karnak.
"[I saw the digging of a lake,"
which His Majesty made for himself on the west side] <11> of the city.
Its banks were planted with all kinds of sweet trees.
"I saw the digging of the rock tomb of His Majesty in private,"
"unseen, unheard."
I investigated what could be useful for this.
My mind was vigilant seeking what would be useful.
"I created clay fields,"
to cover their tombs in the necropolis.
These were works that hadn't been done before.
What was ordered to me to be done there happened thoroughly.
"<13> I took thought for posterity,"
which was labour close to my heart.
"My character was wise,"
no instruction was given to me by an elder.
I will be praised on account of my wisdom
for years afterwards by those who will emulate what I have done.
<14> I was highest administrator of all works.
"Praise for me endured in the palace,"
the love for me with the courtiers.
"His Majesty endowed me with labourers,"
my provisions were from the storehouse of the palace every day.
The king departed from this life
"and went to heaven,"
having completed his years in happiness.
"[had appeared on the Horus-throne,]"
"<15> the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Aakheperenre,"
so that he would govern the Black Land
"and rule the Red Land,"
having taken possession of the Two Banks in triumph.
I was a confidant of the king in each of his offices.
He did more for me than others before.
"I reached the old age of the honoured elders,"
"I was in the favour of His Majesty every day,"
"I was served from the table of the king,"
"<16> with bread from the royal breakfast,"
"also beer,"
"rich meat,"
"vegetables,"
"different kinds of fruit,"
"honey,"
"cakes,"
wine and ben oil.
I was greeted with 'health and life!'
"and His Majesty himself said it, for love for me."
He went to heaven
and united with the gods.
His son took his place as king of the Two Lands
and he ruled on the throne of his begetter.
"<17> His sister, the god's wife Hatshepsut,"
governed the land;
the Two Lands were under her direction.
"She is served,"
"while Egypt is humble,"
"beneficent seed of the god, which came from him,"
"prow rope of Upper Egypt,"
"mooring post of the southeners,"
"she is the excellent stern rope of Lower Egypt,"
"a mistress of command,"
"with excellent plans,"
who satisfies the Two Banks when she speaks.
"Her Majesty praised me,"
"she loved me,"
she recognised my excellence in the palace.
"She enriched me with property,"
"she advanced me,"
"she filled my hut with silver and gold,"
"and all good things of the palace,"
without me saying
"'O, I wish I had ...!' about anything."
"I say to you, people:"
'Hear! Do good things.
"What was done for me <19> will likewise be done for you,"
"the passing of my lifetime was in peace,"
"there was no crime of mine,"
"my years were in happiness,"
"there was no enmity towards me,"
"there was no accusation against me,"
"I was not feeble,"
"there was no reproach against me,"
"I was a leader of leaders,"
"there was no complaint against me,"
"loyal to his lord,"
free of carelessness.
I was one who listened to what his superior had said.
I was not full of resentments towards the great ones in the palace.
I did what my city god loved.
I was free of pilfering from the property of the god.
"As for one who passes years being praised,"
"his soul will live beside the Lord of All,"
"his good name will be in the mouths of the living,"
his memory and his blessedness are for eternity.'
"Revered,"
"count,"
"overseer of the storehouses of Amun,"
"the scribe Ineni, justified."
"<6> The sovereign bestowed on me another favour,"
because I was [so excellent] in his [opinion].
He appointed me as controller of works 
"He [knew] me as a truly just man,"
"composed,"
"reticent,"
and discrete about the affairs of the palace (l.p.h.).
"I was appointed as overseer of the granaries,"
"city mayor,"
<8> I did not pilfer from the god's offerings
on the day of measuring provisions;
the god's offerings according to its ratio;
"<9> The fear of my god was in my mind,"
the fright of (my) lord was in my heart.
"Who is praised by his lord is not insolent,"
who is praised by his god does not pilfer.
"<10> (I) reached old age in the southern city,"
blessedness in the one that is in front of its lord.
"Favours towards me were from its great ones,"
love for me was with its commoners.
"I didn't rob,"
I didn't overthrow. 
<11> After death I am buried in my tomb of the necropolis.
My soul goes out
and [it] is well-supplied [on earth].
It [traverses] its garden as it pleases.
I transform
and I go out by day.
"I refresh myself under the sycamores,"
and drink as I please.
I will not be turned back by the door keepers of the gates of the west.
"(I) said that which (I) said to you,"
so that everyone sees.
"There is no falsehood,"
"(I) spoke in truth,"
not in [untruth].
Now may you [see] <13> my character
and do likewise.
"It will be useful for you,"
your life will endure on earth
"in well-being,"
"you will pass your years in happiness,"
you will pass on your offices to your children
when you take your place of [eternity].
"'I was a nobleman, quiet and modest,"
free of insolence.
"My name will endure because of my character,"
according to what I did on earth.
My soul will be glorified after my death
among those who did good.

"to rule what the sun revolves around,"
"the southern and the northern lands as well,"
"the shares of Horus and Seth,"

"as he sat on the thrones of Geb,"
and the double crown was raised.
"As His Majesty took possession of his inheritance,"
"he sat down on the dais of Horus,"
to widen the borders of Thebes
"and the fields of Khef-her-nebes,"
"to enslave to her the bedouin,"
"<4> the hill dwellers,"
"those abominated by god,"

no losses occurred to the evil ones
who had come to its aid.
Not one thereof remained.
"When the Troglodytes fell to terror,"
"and were thrown aside throughout their lands,"

"that you sanctify the foremost of those in the west,"
"the great god of the primordial time,"
"whose position Atum advanced,"
"whom he made great before <3> his [children],"
"according to whose will he founded the land,"
"whom the kings of Upper and Lower Egypt have served,"
since this land was founded.

"His Majesty commanded the treasurer to direct works,"
"and the best of his staff,"
"who know the instructions,"
"who are experienced in what they know,"
"and who do not neglect what they were commanded,"
"<7> to [build] a monument for his father [Osiris],"
"to create his statue for eternity,"
"which was embellished and kept very secret,"
"not seen, not beheld,"
"its form unknown,"
for which was created a beautiful palanquin
"of silver, gold, lapis lazuli, black copper,"
and every kind of precious stone.
"I provided him with offering tables,"
"sceptres, sistra, menits,"
"censers, and bowls."
"My great offerings were there,"
"which didn't cease,"
as (I) did not end them.
I built for [him] a splendid [Neshmet-barque]
"of real cedar from Lebanon,"
its bow and its stern of electrum.
"It adorned the water,"
"to make its voyage therein,"
at his feast in the district of Peqer.
My Majesty ordered the creation of the Great Ennead
"that is in Abydos,"
calling each of them by his name:
"Khnum, lord of Her-wer, in Abydos,"
"Khnum, lord of Kebehu, in Abydos,"
"Thoth, might of the gods, foremost of Hesret,"
"Horus foremost of Letopolis,"
"Harendotis,"
"Upwawet of Upper Egypt,"
Upwawet of Lower Egypt.
"Their forms were made secret and sacred,"
"the standards thereof were of <12> electrum,"
"made better than they were before,"
"more sacred than what is in heaven,"
"more secret than the fashion of the underworld,"
more [honoured] than those in the primordial waters.
"My Majesty did this for my father Osiris,"
"because I loved him more than all the other gods,"
"so that my name will endure,"
"and my monuments last in the house of my father Osiris,"
"foremost <14> of those in the west,"

"<1> The might of king Aakheperkare, [justified,"
has brought these elephant tusks
from his] victories [in the southern and northern lands.
"His Majesty himself hunted ???] <3> elephants [in the land of
Naharina,"
"while he was on <4> his] chariot,"
[after His Majesty proceeded to overthrow] Upper [Retjenu
on [his ???-th victorious campaign.
His Majesty reached the land] <6> of Niya
[and found these elephants there.
Such has never happened to former] kings.
"[Now, these elephant tusks"
"that] His Majesty [brought] from [this land,"
"he gave them to the house of his father Amun,"
"lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands,"
"after] he returned in [strength, in victory and in triumph,"
having overthrown his enemies.]
"<47:2> Year 1, second month of the Season of Inundation, day 8."
Appearance by the majesty of
"Horus: Mighty bull, powerful in strength;"
Two Ladies: Divine of kingship;
Gold Horus: Mighty of being;
The king of Upper and Lower Egypt: Aakheperenre;
"Son of Re: Tuthmosis, beautiful of appearance,"
on the Horus-throne of the living.
"His father Re is his protection,"
"<47:4> and Amun, lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands,"
while they smite his enemies for him.
"When His Majesty is in the palace,"
"his fame is mighty,"
"<47:5> the fear of him is throughout the land,"
"the awe is in the Aegean lands,"
"the portions of the two lords are under his supervision,"
"the Nine Bows are gathered <47:6> under his feet,"
"the bedouin come to him carrying gifts,"
and the Nubian nomads are carrying tributes.
"His southern boundary reaches to the crest of the world,"
<47:7> the northern to the ends.
"Asia is subject to His Majesty,"
one doesn't repulse his messenger throughout Lebanon.
<47:8> One came to inform His Majesty:
'Vile Kush is preparing to rebel.
Those who are <47:9> subject to the lord of the Two Lands
"are devising a hostile plan,"
"preparing to smite the Egyptians,"
to steal <47:10> the cattle behind these fortresses
"that your father has built during his victories,"
"the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Aakheperkare (may he live forever!),"
"<47:11> to repel the rebellious lands,"
the Nubian nomads from Khent-hen-nefer.'
"Now, there was a ruler in the north of vile Kush"
who was preparing a period of hostility
together with two Nubian nomads
"among the children of the ruler of vile Kush,"
"who had flown from the lord of the Two Lands,"
"on the day of the massacre by the good god,"
"when this foreign land was divided into five parts,"
each one as the guardian of its portion.
Then His Majesty acted against it
"as a panther, after he had heard it."
<47:15> And His Majesty said:
"'As I live, as Re loves me,"
"as my father praises me,"
"the lord of the gods, Amun, the lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands,"
"I will not let <47:16> their men live,"
I will put them to death.'
"Then His Majesty sent a numerous army <48:1> to Taseti,"
"as his first victory,"
"to overthrow all who rebelled against His Majesty,"
the rebels against the lord of the Two Lands.
<48:2> Then this army of His Majesty arrived in vile Kush.
The might of His Majesty guided them
<48:3> and his terror protected their march.
Then this army of His Majesty overthrew these foreigners;
"<48:4> they didn't let their men live,"
"in accordance with everything that His Majesty had ordered,"
"with the exception of one of these <48:5> children of the ruler of
vile Kush,"
"who was brought alive as captive,"
"together with its inhabitants,"
"to <48:6> the place where His Majesty was,"
and who were placed under the feet of the good god.
"His Majesty appeared on the dais,"
while <48:7> the captives were dragged in
whom this army of His Majesty had brought.
"This foreign land was made subject to <48:8> His Majesty,"
as its former state had been.
"The people were cheering and exulting,"
"the infantry was in <48:9> joy,"
"they gave praise to the lord of the Two Lands,"
they lauded this excellent god
on account of <48:10> his divinity.
"It happened because of the fame of His Majesty,"
"because his father Amun loved him so much,"
"more than any king who lived <48:11> since the primeval time of the
land,"
"the king of Upper and Lower Egypt: Aakheperenre,"
"Son of Re: Tuthmosis, beautiful of appearance,"
"given life, stability and dominion, like Re forever."
"'Let an offering be made of a thousand loaves of bread,"
"a hundred jars of beer,"
one ox and two balls of incense
"to the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Djoser, justified,"
"and let there be given one cake, one jug of beer,"
a large portion of meat and one ball of incense
"to the chief lector priest [Imhotep],"
as I have seen an example of his learning.'
And one did as everything that His Majesty had ordered.
"Then prince Chephren stood up to speak, and said:"
"<1,18> 'I will let Your Majesty hear a wonder that happened"
"in the time of your forefather Nebka, justified,"
"as he proceeded to the temple of Ptah,"
"<1,20> lord of Ankh-tawi."
After (some) days had passed after this --
there was a pavilion in the garden of Ubainer --
"the commoner said <2,5> to the wife of Ubainer:"
"&quot;Is there not a pavilion <2,6> in the garden of Ubainer?"
"Look, let us spend some time in it.&quot;"
"<2,7> Then the wife of Ubainer sent a message to the caretaker"
"who <2,8> was in charge of the garden, to say:"
"After <2,11> it had become evening, he came out,"
"and he <2,12> went down to the pool,"
"<2,15> When the second day dawned,"
"<2,20> [bank] of the water."
"<2,21> And Ubainer said:"
"Then he gave it to the caretaker, and said to him:"
"<3,2> &quot;As soon as the commoner has gone into the pool,"
"as is his daily custom,"
The caretaker then went
"and took <3,5> the crocodile of wax with him."
Then the wife of Ubainer sent a message to the caretaker
"who was in charge of the garden, to say:"
"&quot;Let <3,7> the pavilion that is in the garden be prepared,"
since I'm coming to sit in it.&quot;
"Then the pavilion was prepared <3,9> with every good thing,"
and they went and spent a happy day with the commoner.
After it had become evening
"the commoner came out, as was his daily custom."
"Then the caretaker threw the crocodile <3,13> of wax after him into
the water,"
"and it became a crocodile of seven cubits,"
"Now, Ubainer was to remain"
"with the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Nebka,
justified,"
"for seven days,"
"After the seven days had passed,"
"Then the chief lector priest Ubainer placed himself before (His
Majesty),"
May your majesty proceed and may you see the wonder
Then the chief lector priest Ubainer said:
"Then the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Nebka,
justified, said:"
&quot;Perhaps it is a crocodile.&quot;
"Ubainer then bent down and picked it up,"
and in his hand it was a crocodile of wax.
"Then, the chief lector priest Ubainer <4,4> recounted"
"this thing that the commoner had been doing in his house with his
<4,5> wife"
"to the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Nebka, justified."
"Then His Majesty said to the <4,6> crocodile:"
&quot;Take what is yours!&quot;
and the place where it went with him never became known.
"<4,8> Then the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Nebka,
justified, had the wife of Ubainer taken away"
to a plot of land north of the residence
"and he burnt her,"
"Look, a wonder that happened"
"in the time of your forefather the king of Upper and Lower Egypt
Nebka,"
which is something that the chief lector priest Ubainer did.'
"Then the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Cheops,
justified, said:"
"'Let an offering be made of a thousand loaves of bread,"
"a hundred jars of beer,"
"one ox <4,14> and two balls of incense"
"to the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Nebka, justified,"
"and let there be given <4,15> one cake, one jug of beer,"
a large portion of meat and one ball of incense
"<4,16> to the chief lector priest Ubainer,"
"as I have seen an example <4,17> of his learning.'"
And one did as everything that His Majesty had ordered.
"Then Bauefre stood up to speak, and said:"
"'I will let Your Majesty hear a wonder that happened <4,19> in the
time of your forefather Snofru, justified,"
and that is something that the chief lector priest Djadjaemankh did.
"every [room] of the palace (l.p.h.!) to seek distraction for himself,"
but he couldn't find any.
"Then he said: &quot;Go and bring me the chief lector priest <4,24> and
book-scribe Djadjaemankh.&quot;"
And he was brought to him immediately.
Then His Majesty said to him:
&quot;I've gone through every room of the palace (l.p.h.!)
"to seek distraction for myself,"
but I couldn't find any.&quot;
Then Djadjaemankh said to him:
"&quot;O <5,2> may Your Majesty proceed to the lake of the palace
(l.p.h.!),"
"and man a ship <5,3> with all beautiful women from inside your palace."
"The heart of Your Majesty will be gladdened <5,4> by seeing them row a
trip back and forth,"
"<5,5> and seeing the beautiful reeds of your lake,"
"and <5,6> seeing its (surrounding) fields and its beautiful
watersides."
"Your heart will <5,7> be gladdened by this.&quot;"
&quot;So I will arrange my rowing trip.
"Let me be brought <5,8> twenty oars of ebony plated with gold,"
"with handles <5,9> of <al>sqb</al>-wood plated with electrum."
"Let me be brought twenty women <5,10> who have beautiful bodies,"
"who have well-developed bosoms, who have braided hair,"
"<5,11> and who have not been opened by childbirth."
And let me be brought twenty nets
"and let these nets be given to these women after their clothes have
been taken off.&quot;"
And one did as everything that His Majesty had ordered.
"Then they rowed back and forth,"
"and the heart of His Majesty was gladdened by <5,15> seeing them row."
Then one woman who was at the stroke oar got entangled in her braids
and a fish-pendant of new turquoise fell into the water.
"Then she became still, without rowing,"
"<5,18> and her side became still, without rowing."
Then His Majesty said:
&quot;Can't you row?&quot;
"And they said: &quot;Our stroke <5,20> has become still, without
rowing.&quot;"
Then His Majesty said to her:
&quot;Why aren't you rowing?&quot;
And she said:
"&quot;This fish-pendant of new turquoise <5,22> has fallen into the
water.&quot;"
And she said: &quot;I prefer my own thing to its substitute.&quot;
Then His Majesty said:
&quot;Go and bring me the chief lector priest Djadjaemankh.&quot;
And he was brought to him immediately.
Then His Majesty said:
"&quot;Djadjaemankh, my brother,"
"I have done as what you have said,"
"and the heart of <6,2> His Majesty was gladdened"
by seeing them row.
Then a fish-pendant of new turquoise of one of the strokes
"fell into the water,"
"and she became still, <6,4> without rowing."
And so it happened that she disrupted her side.
Then I said to her:
"<6,5> 'Why is it that you're not rowing?'"
And she said to me:
'This fish-pendant of new turquoise has fallen into the water.'
Then I said to her:
"'Row! Look, I myself will replace <6,7> it.'"
And she said to me: 'I prefer my own thing to its substitute.' &quot;
Then the chief lector priest Djadjaemankh said his magic spell
"and put <6,9> one side of the water of the lake on top of the other,"
"and found the fish-pendant <6,10> lying on a shard."
He then fetched it and gave it to its owner.
"Now, as for <6,11> the water, it was twelve cubits in its middle,"
and it ended up being twenty-four cubits after its folding up.
Then he said his magic spell
"and returned the parts of water of the <6,13> lake to their positions."
His Majesty spent a day of celebration
"with <6,14> the entire royal household (l.p.h.!),"
"and finally he rewarded the chief lector priest <6,15> Djadjaemankh"
with every good thing.
"Look, a wonder that happened <6,16> in the time of your forefather the
king of Upper and Lower Egypt Snofru, justified,"
"and that is something that the chief lector priest and book-scribe
Djadjaemankh did.'"
"Then the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Cheops,
justified, said:"
"'Let an offering be made of a thousand loaves of bread,"
"a hundred jars of beer,"
"<6,19> one ox and two balls of incense"
"to the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Snofru,"
"justified,"
"<6,20> and let there be given one cake, one jug of beer"
and a ball of incense
"to the chief lector priest and book-scribe Djadjaemankh,"
as I have seen an example of his learning.'
"<6,22> And one did as everything that His Majesty had ordered."
"Then prince Hordedef stood up to <6,23> speak, and said:"
one cannot distinguish truth from falsehood.
"And His Majesty said: 'What is this, <6,26> Hordedef, my son?'"
Prince Hordedef said:
"'There is a commoner <7,1> called Djedi"
who lives in Djed-Snofru.
"He is <7,2> a commoner a hundred and ten years old,"
"who eats five hundred loaves of bread, a shoulder of beef for <7,3>
meat,"
"and drinks a hundred jars of beer, up to this day."
He knows how to mend a severed head.
"He knows how to make a lion walk behind him,"
with its leash on the ground.
"He knows the number of chambers <7,6> of the sanctuary of Thoth.'"
"Now, the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Cheops,
justified, spent the day"
"<7,7> seeking for himself these chambers of the sanctuary of Thoth,"
"in order to make something similar for himself, for his 'horizon'."
His Majesty said:
"'You yourself, Hordedef, my son, will bring <7,9> him to me!'"
"Then boats were prepared for prince Hordedef,"
and he went southward to Djed-Snofru.
"<7,11> After the boats had been moored to the river bank,"
he travelled overland
"seated in a palanquin of ebony,"
"with poles <7,13> of <al>ssnDm</al>-wood"
plated with gold.
"When he had reached Djedi,"
"<7,14> the palanquin was set down."
Then he stood up to greet him.
"while a servant at his head <7,16> was anointing him,"
and another was rubbing his feet.
Then prince Hordedef said:
"'Your condition is like that of one who lives before the infirmity of
old age"
"(although old age means <7,18> dying, laying to rest, and burial)"
"and who sleeps till dawn, free from illness,"
without an old age of coughing.
"Greeting, <7,20> O blessed one!"
I have come here to summon you by order
"<7,21> of my father Cheops, justified."
"You will eat delicacies provided by the king,"
"the foods <7,22> of his companions."
"He will lead you through a good lifetime,"
"and to your forefathers <7,23> who are in the necropolis.'"
"And this Djedi said: 'Welcome, welcome, Hordedef,"
"prince <7,24> who is beloved of his father!"
"May your father Cheops, justified, favour you."
"May he advance <7,25> your position among the elders."
May your spirit contend with your enemy
"and may your soul know <7,26> the roads that lead to the portal of him
who shelters the dead."
"Greeting, <8,1> O prince!'"
"Then prince Hordedef held out his arms to him,"
"and <8,2> raised him up."
"Then he proceeded with him to the river bank,"
giving him his arm.
"<8,3> Djedi then said:"
'Let me be given one of the barges
"so that it may bring me the children <8,4> and my books.'"
"Then two boats were made available to him, together with their crew."
And Djedi came northward
in the barge in which prince Hordedef was.
"After he had reached the residence,"
prince Hordedef entered
"<8,7> to report to the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt
Cheops, justified,"
and prince Hordedef said:
"'Sovereign (l.p.h.!), my lord,"
I have brought Djedi.'
His Majesty said:
'Go and bring him to me!'
"His Majesty then proceeded to the audience hall of <8,10> the palace
(l.p.h.!),"
and Djedi was ushered in to him.
Then His Majesty said:
"'How is it, Djedi, <8,11> that I haven't been made to see you
(before)?'"
And Djedi said:
"'He comes who is summoned, <8,12> sovereign (l.p.h.!)."
"Summon me, and look, I've come.'"
Then His Majesty said:
"'Is it the truth what they say,"
that you know how to mend a severed head?'
"<8,14> And Djedi said:"
"'Yes, I know how to, sovereign (l.p.h.!), my lord.'"
"<8,15> Then His Majesty said:"
"'Let me be brought a criminal who is in prison,"
and let his sentence be executed.'
Whereupon Djedi said:
"'But not to a human, sovereign (l.p.h.!), my lord!"
"<8,17> Look, doing something like that to the 'noble flock' is not
ordained.'"
"Then <8,18> a goose was brought to him and its head was cut off."
The goose was placed at the west side of the audience hall
and its head at the east side of the audience hall.
"Then Djedi said his magic spell,"
"<8,21> and the goose stood up, waddling,"
its head likewise.
"After one had reached the other,"
"<8,23> the goose stood up, cackling."
"Then he had a <al>xt-aA</al>-goose brought to him,"
and the same was done to it.
"Then His Majesty had a bull brought to him,"
"<8,25> and its head was felled to the ground."
"Then Djedi said his magic spell,"
"<8,26> and the bull stood up behind him,"
"its leash having fallen on <9,1> the ground."
"Then king Cheops, justified, said:"
"'Now, what is said is that"
"you know <9,2> the number of chambers of the sanctuary of Thoth.'"
And Djedi said:
"'I beg your pardon, I don't know the number thereof, sovereign
(l.p.h.!), my lord,"
but I know the place where it is kept.'
Then His Majesty said:
"'So, where?'"
And this Djedi said:
"'There is a casket <9,5> of flint in a room called the Inventory in
Heliopolis;"
"(well, it is) in that casket.'"
(Then His Majesty said: 'Go and bring it to me!')
And Djedi said:
"<9,6> 'Sovereign (l.p.h.!), my lord,"
"look, I am not the one who will bring it to you.'"
Then His Majesty said:
"'Who then <9,7> will bring it to me?'"
And Djedi said:
'The eldest of the three children who are in the womb of Ruddjedet
will bring it to you.'
Then His Majesty said:
'I want it!
"These things you say, who is <9,9> she, this Ruddjedet?'"
And Djedi said:
"'She is the wife of a priest of Re, lord of Sakhbu,"
"<9,10> who is pregnant with three children of Re, lord of Sakhbu."
He has said about it:
&quot;They will perform this magisterial office in this entire land.
The eldest of them will be high priest in Heliopolis.&quot; '
And His Majesty fell into a bad mood at this.
Then Djedi said:
"'What's this mood, sovereign (l.p.h.!), my lord?"
"Was it caused by the <9,14> three children that I mentioned?"
"First your son, then his son, then one of them.'"
Then His Majesty said:
"<9,15> 'When will Ruddjedet give birth?'"
(And Djedi said:)
'She will give birth
on the fifteenth day of the first month of the Season of Growing.'
Then His Majesty said:
'But that's when the sandbanks of Two-Fish Canal are cut off.
"Might I visit it myself,"
"so that <9,17> I could see the temple of Re, lord of Sakhbu!'"
And Djedi said:
"'Then I will let <9,18> four cubits of water appear on the sandbanks
of Two-Fish Canal.'"
And His Majesty proceeded to his palace.
"<9,19> Then His Majesty said:"
"'Have Djedi assigned to the house of prince Hordedef,"
"he will reside <9,20> with him,"
"and he will be provided with a thousand loaves of bread,"
"a hundred jars of beer,"
one ox and a hundred bundles of vegetables.'
And one did as everything that His Majesty had ordered.
"One of those days,"
Ruddjedet was suffering
while her labour was difficult.
"Then the majesty of Re, lord of Sakhbu, said"
"<9,23> to Isis, Nephthys, Meskhenet, Heqet and Khnum:"
'O may you go
"and deliver Ruddjedet of the three children who are in her womb,"
"who will perform this magisterial office in this entire land,"
"for they will build your temples,"
"<9,26> provision your altars,"
"make your libation vessels abundant,"
and increase your divine offerings.'
"Then these gods proceeded,"
"after they had changed their appearance into that of musicians,"
and Khnum was with them carrying luggage.
"Then they arrived at the house of Reusre,"
and found him standing with his kilt upside down.
"<10,3> Then they presented him with their menits and sistra."
He then said to them:
"<10,4> 'My ladies, look, there is a woman who is suffering,"
for her labour is difficult.'
Then they said:
"'Let us see her,"
for we are knowledgeable about childbirth.'
"And he said to <10,6> them: 'Come in!'"
"Then they entered, towards Ruddjedet,"
"<10,7> and they locked the room with her and them in it."
"Then Isis placed herself before her,"
"<10,8> Nephthys behind her, and Heqet was hastening the birth."
Then Isis said:
"<10,9> 'May you not be powerful in her womb, in this name of yours of
Userref!'"
"And this child rushed into her arms, a baby of one cubit,"
"his bones were strong, his limbs were destined to be of gold,"
and his scalp of real lapis lazuli.
"And they washed him, after his umbilical cord had been cut,"
and he was placed on a couch of brick.
Then Meskhenet approach him
and said:
'A king who will perform the kingship in this entire land!'
And Khnum made his body healthy.
"Then Isis placed herself before her,"
"Nephthys behind her, and Heqet was hastening the birth."
"<10,16> Then Isis said:"
"'May you not kick in her womb, in this name of yours of Sahure!'"
"And this child rushed into her arms, <10,18> a baby of one cubit,"
"his bones were strong, his limbs were destined to be (of gold),"
and his scalp of real lapis lazuli.
"And they washed him, after his umbilical cord had been cut,"
"and he was placed on <10,20> a couch of brick."
Then Meskhenet approach him
"and <10,21> said:"
'A king who will perform the kingship in this entire land!'
And Khnum made his limbs healthy.
"Then Isis placed herself before her,"
"Nephthys behind her, <10,23> and Heqet was hastening the birth."
Then Isis said:
"'May you not stay dark <10,24> in her womb, in this name of yours of
Keku!'"
"And this child rushed into <10,25> her arms, a baby of one cubit,"
"his bones were strong, his limbs were destined to be of gold,"
"<10,26> and his scalp of real lapis lazuli."
Then Meskhenet approach him
"<11,1> and said:"
'A king who will perform the kingship in this entire land!'
And Khnum made his limbs healthy.
"And they washed him, after his umbilical cord had been cut,"
and he was placed on a couch of brick.
"These gods then went out,"
"having delivered Ruddjedet of the three children,"
"<11,5> and they said:"
"'Rejoice, Reusre,"
for three children have been born to you!'
Then he said to them:
"'My ladies, what can I do for <11,7> you?"
"Please give this barley to your bearer,"
"<11,8> and accept it as a tip.'"
"Then Khnum loaded himself with the barley,"
"and they proceeded to where <11,10> they had come from."
Then Isis said to these gods:
"'What is it <11,11> that we have come for,"
"if not to perform a wonder for these <11,12> children"
that we may report to their father who let us come?'
"Then <11,13> they created three lordly crowns (l.p.h.!),"
"and they put them in the <11,14> barley."
"Then they made the sky turn into storm and rain,"
"<11,15> and they returned to the house."
They said:
"'Please put the barley here in a sealed room,"
"until we return <11,17> from making music in the north.'"
And they put the barley in a sealed room.
Then Ruddjedet became pure in a purification of fourteen days.
Then she said to her maid:
'Has the house been prepared?'
And she said:
'It has been prepared with every good thing
"except <11,21> for the jars;"
they haven't been brought.'
Then Ruddjedet said:
'But why haven't the jars been brought?'
And the maid said:
"<11,23> 'There is nothing for contents here,"
"except for the barley of these <11,24> musicians,"
which is in a room under their seal.'
Then Ruddjedet said:
"'Go down and fetch it from there,"
"and Reusre will give them <11,26> compensation for it after he
returns.'"
"And the maid went <12,1> and opened the room."
"Then she heard the noise of singing, music making, dancing, cheering"
"<12,2> and everything that is done for a king, in the room."
Then she went
"and recounted everything she had heard <12,3> to Ruddjedet."
"Then she went through the room,"
but couldn't find the place where it was done.
"<12,4> Then she put her ear to the sack,"
and found it was being done in it.
"Then she put <12,5> (it) in a box,"
"which was put in another chest,"
bound with leather.
"She put it <12,6> in a room containing her belongings,"
and locked it up.
"Then Reusre returned, <12,7> coming from the land,"
"and Ruddjedet recounted this matter to him,"
and he was exceedingly happy.
Then they sat down for a day of celebration.
"Now, when some days had passed after this,"
Ruddjedet had a quarrel with the maid
and had her punished with a beating.
"Then the maid said <12,11> to the people in the household:"
"'Is it done, this, to me?"
She has given birth to three kings;
I'll go and tell this
"to the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Cheops,"
justified!'
And she went
"and found her eldest uncle on her mother's side,"
"binding flax and yarn <12,14> on the terrace."
And he said to her:
"'Where are you making off to, little girl?'"
"<12,15> And she recounted this matter to him."
Then her uncle said to her:
"'And what is to be done <12,16> is what you do, coming to me,"
and I should join in the betrayal?'
Then he took a bundle of flax to her
and administered her a nasty blow.
"Then the maid went to get a cup of water for herself,"
and a crocodile snatched her.
"Her uncle then went to tell this to Ruddjedet,"
and he found Ruddjedet sitting in grief;
her mood was exceedingly bad.
Then he said to her:
"'My lady, why are you in this mood?'"
And she said:
'It's the girl who grew up in this house.
"Look, <12,23> she has gone, saying:"
&quot;I'll go and betray.&quot; '
"Then he bent his head <12,24> down"
and said:
"<12,25> she might go with me."
Then I administered her a nasty blow.
"Then she went to draw some water for herself,"
and a crocodile snatched her.'
i am one who says what is good and repeats what is loved
his majesty appointed me scribe of the cadaster and his majesty showed me great favour
and how egypt sails depends on what you command
although it is found with slave-girls at the mill-stones
behold i am before thee
i placed myself on my belly
overseer of the house
possessor of veneration venerable
the king of egypt
the great ones of abydus
i will take away thy ass peasant because it is eating my corn
i set out early when it was day
such is osiris
after thy own old age
there is no tomb for him-who-rebels against his majesty
it was of 30 cubits
to thee belongs gold
behold thou art a city without a ruler
this is an instruction
lo his majesty was himself in the eastern fortress
there is no misstatement therein
there is indeed no boasting therein
thou shalt have thy former heart
it seemed to him like heaven
thou art the father of the orphan
the name of her mother is tjuia
this is the road of thoth to the house of maet
what is pray the thing which thou hast done to it
who is he
it is i who am the ruler of pwenet
he was a peasant of the wady natrun
a mans goodness is his monument
lo he was a beneficent son
i am not forsooth a confederate of his
greater was my praise in the palace than that of any unique friend
how like to her it is!
i will cause him to become acquainted with thy greatness
the incense it belongs to me
behold god has caused thee to live
as to anyone who does not know this spell he shall never enter
as to all which is in writing on the papyrus-roll hear it
if thou harkenest to this that i have said to thee every plan of thine will go forward
if thou art well-to-do thou shalt found thy house
the priests who-are-in their times
every one thereof
my favours from the king
within two months
in two months
by him in whose body the pains are
like one who has not been ill
if the face of this fall to the ground nut will fall to the ground
thereupon this official placed the command before me as follows
who is it that has brought thee
wealth does not indeed come of itself
i speak i cause you to hear
as for a temple day it is the three hundred and sixtieth part of the year
in the favour of sokar!
finding him by his majesty
he placed me in front of his children
mayst thou go out and in without being driven back and without being turned away from the door of the netherworld
whose name is not known
beware of eating the adu-fish
welcome to me
cause my name to be fair in thy city
their wine was found lying in their presses
a chariot wrought in gold
lo i was standing and i heard or as i was standing i heard
thou shalt cause provisions to be given to him
now while i was stretched on my belly
i found it was a serpent which was coming
the heart of thy majesty will be refreshed at seeing
a ship will come from home
behold i will take away thy ass peasant
haste thee
tarry thou
do not be puffed up on account of thy knowledge
let us not go upon that difficult road
let not men see
thou shalt do nothing concerning it
he will not fail to do good to the land which will be loyal to him
it is more useful for him who does it than him for whom it is done
o ye who love life and hate death
every son of mine who shall strengthen this boundary
behold it is the supporting of the chief which is done by thee
but as to everyone over whom it is read every day
his son who is beloved of him
praised of hathor
one to whom judges listen
all that he gave to me
i did what men love and what the gods praise or i did what is loved of men and what is praised of the gods
of which my lord l p h said i will cause it to be made for thee
thou wilt not find anything whereon thou mayst rest
the making of all changes into which he may wish to change
these things which i have given to these priests
sailors being in it whom thou knowest
there is nothing at all which he does not know
he who was formerly a messenger now sends another
now as for him who shall lose it and shall not fight on behalf of it
provide not for to-morrow before it has come
they could foretell a storm before it came and a tempest before it happened
i came into existence when bulls had not yet been born and cows had not yet been made
how hast thou come to this pass
i have come to you in order that i may break your water-pots
behold i have written commending thee to the steward
as for him who sails with falsehood for a cargo he does not reach land
behold three children have been born to thee
now these fields had been made into plough-lands
it is to be mixed together
i made for myself this tomb it being consecrated and its place being embellished at the staircase of the great god
his head is not or has not been taken away from him
then the choice joints shall be removed from the altars of the gods
says he namely atum
the land sails in accordance with thy commmand
i used to sail down with its tribute to the king every year and went forth thence vindicated and no deficiency was found in me
may thy majesty do as he wills
i spent 110 years of life which the king gave to me
whenever heaven rages
as when water flows
she will give birth on the fifteenth day of the first month of winter
may the inundation god bring him his offering may he eat with his mouth may he see with his eyes
then let us make a habitation together
o that thou mayst act according as i say
i have never seen the like of this goose
no one had run after me
i do not know who brought me to this country
but it is found with handmaidens at their mill-stones
thereupon his majesty kept sending to me with presents
then i reached the red sea
then he laughed at me
never had it been done since the time of king snofru the justified
they were more beautiful than that which had existed formerly
is the saying true
it that-of-thirty cubits

"The offering to me, O Atum, the offering to me, O Atum!"
Unas flourishes .
"Let the eastern bearers repeat, ‘It is your bread .’"
Purify the mouth of Unas!
Hunger is what Unas detests; he cannot eat it .
"As for that by which he Horus lives, let Unas live thereon ."
You cannot go dead .
May you beware the lake .
"Let your bearers go, your heralds hurry to your father, to Atum ."
Make him rise up!
"May you remember him, this Unas!"
To you has she come .
To you comes Unas .

Let your father see you .

And issue commands to the mounds of Horus!
"Oh, you Neferkare! Turn yourself about, O Neferkare!"
Let the old one go .
Against you do I say this .
"Unas’s having bitten the earth, Unas’s having bitten Geb, was Unas’s having bitten the father of the one who bit him ."
"Be washed, O serpent, for me!"
Do not ignore me!
Unas does not know .
I will cast down this which goes forth from your mouth against you yourself .
Let me give it to you .
Unas comes even to you .
"May you open your place in the sky, among the stars of the sky ."
"Arise, O Unas, as one upon whom are horns, the double wild bull!"
Let your name endure with men .
Your son Horus has acted for you .

Make a way for Unas!
"Unas has come, even that you see him transformed into the great god ."
Unas has become pure even in the field of rushes .
Make a place for Unas!
Setting up my two standards in front of the great ones .
Setting up Teti’s two standards in front of the great ones .
"O one whom I bore, shining of horn, eye painted pillar, bull of the sky ."
Set your title down for Teti!
Unas has inherited from Geb: Unas has inherited from Geb .
Let Unas take the sky .
Unas will not enter into Geb .
What Teti detests is the land .
"Unas is Horus, the heir of his father ."
Let him raise himself up to that which he desires!
The protection of Unas is my eye .
"Unas is a flame in the wind, to the ends of the sky, to the ends of the earth ."
Do not forget Teti .
I thus saying ‘One who is at peace who is alone!’
Pepi saying to you .
The two reed boats of the sky are given to Unas .
"There will he really be born, renewed and rejuvenated ."
Even with a summons to you being made by Re .
Even with a summons to Teti being made by Re .
That Teti’s ferrying might be ferried thereon to that eastern side of the sky .
"that my father’s traveling might be traveled thereon to the horizon of the sky,"
The two reed boats of the sky are given to Pepi also .
"Bringing to Pepi these four of the passing by, the side lock wearers, who stand upon their staves in the eastern side of the sky ."
The two reed boats of the sky are given to Pepi .
"That Pepi cross by them to the horizon, to Re ."
"Do bring to Pepi these four brothers, the ones of passing by, the ones of the side lock, who sit upon their staves in the eastern side of the sky ."
For his part the heart of Unas is his .
that you row in the sky in your bark .
Let him cross to the field of rushes .
Let Neith wash her hands .
That he row in the sky in your bark
May you cross to the field of rushes .
"Let Unas love you, O gods, and may you love him, O gods ."
"Let Unas you love, O gods, and love him, O gods ."
"Let Pepi love you, O gods, and may you love me Pepi . O gods ."
"Merenre has come to his side, just as a god comes beside him ."
No one living will accuse me Merenre .
Even that you ferry him .
the one who joined the two lands is Neferkare .
And let Neferkare ascend upon this ladder which his father Re made for him .
To you has Unas come .
Yet he is stronger than him .
Yet Teti is stronger than him .
"Unas is one who eats their magic, who swallows their Akh power ."
To you has Unas come .
Cause that Unas be protected!
It is Unas .
"Give to me now, O Au serpent tjubes, meat now, and a vessel ."
"The lion of Pehti, the lion of Petjti, the Pehti and Petjti of Unas ."
My utterance is mine .
"I will indeed thrust this talon of his against you, the left ."
"I will indeed thrust this talon of his against you, the left ."
As I fight .
‘Maimer’ is my name .
I will indeed attack with this: I will indeed attack with this .
Nor perform your task with Unas .
"Praise of you is expelled, O Baahedj, by the one who goes forth as the worm ."
And do not let Unas see you!
"Unas is Horus, who came forth from the acacia, who came forth from the acacia ."
"for whom it was commanded ‘Beware, O lion!’"
Unas is the one who will survive .
Attend to Unas!
Attend to me!
The hand of Unas is come upon you .
"While his diadem is upon him, against this serpent, which rose from the earth, which is under the fingers of Unas ."
I will not be striven with .
Teti will not be striven with .
"As for the one whom Unas might find in his way, he will eat him, he being devoured ."
Bring this to Unas!
That Unas has given you your Pat cake .
That you Unas has given your Pat cake .
May Pepi be red by it in its name of ‘willow .’
"may you be red by it, in this its name of ‘willow,’"
The throne of Unas is yours .
The two Enneads have performed priestly service for Unas .
"That which Neferkare accordingly destroyed, that he might thus rise up to the sky ."
That he cross to the firmament .
That I cross to the firmament .
That he cross to the firmament .
‘And you are the seed of Geb’ – thus did Osiris command the appearance of Unas .
that which Unas destroyed in order to rise up to the sky
Open the way of Unas!
And Unas is between them .
"‘Stand, O Unas,’ says Horus . ‘Be seated, O Unas,’ says Seth ."
Let them make a raising up for Unas before them .
Let them make a raising up for you before them .
"The gods the Bas of Buto, and the gods the Bas of Hierakonpolis, come to me ."
"May you ascend, O Unas, to the sky ."
And yet behold: you have become the enduring bull of the wild bulls .
A Heliopolitan is Unas .
Send forth the voice for Unas!
Unas sits before him .
For Horus is Unas .
"Bring to Unas ‘Just as it flies, so does it alight!’"
"Which ferryboat, O Unas, should be brought to you?"
which ferryboat should be brought to you?
He will not forget the offering which is to be given .
I would not the offering which is to be given .
Let Unas make Henu gesture and again for you .
Let me make Henu gesture and again for you .
"Ah, let fly the bread to my houses,1075 to the houses of Neith!"
For Horus is Unas .
It is Unas .
Unas does not give you his magic .
"Unas is Sobek, green of plumage, vigilant of sight, who raises the brow ."
Teti is the irritated serpent .

How great is my father!
O my father Neferkare .
O my father Neferkare .
Let me place you on the brow of my father Merenre .
O my father Neferkare .
O my father Neferkare .
In the eye of my father do I put you .
"Unguent for my father, unguent for "
O my father .
"Hail to you, O my father, on this day!"
O my father Neferkare .
"And witness this purification of my father Osiris Pepi, the Netjeru purification with Zemern natron and Bed natron ."
"Greeting, O my father Neferkare!"
"Greeting, O my father Osiris Pepi!"
My father has made his heart for himself .
And as for the one who acts for my father .
Have no mercy on anyone whom my father hates .
O my father Osiris Pepi .
And my father was thus served well .
"O one who smote my father, O one who slew one who is greater than him ."

"Be enclosed, O my father, by the god’s booth!"
O my father Osiris .
O my father Neferkare .
O my father Neferkare .
That my father’s traveling might be traveled thereon to the horizon of the sky .
O my father Merenre .
Neferkare has not striven with the king .
"Those who are neither taken away to the king, nor taken out to the nobles ."
Pepi will not die because of the king .
Neith will not die because of the king; Neith will not die because of a man .
He does not strive with the king: he does not aid Bastet .
Fire being far from Neferkare .
And Unas will not be given to your fire .
As for any god who would put his arm adversarily .
Let them not cross their arms .
As for any Akh or any god whose hand will cross to Neferkare .
There is no adversary who would cross himself in the way of Pepi .
The hindrance of arms on Neferkare having been removed by the one who removes injustice before Khentirti in Letopolis .
Let it cut out the hearts of those who would cross themselves to Neferkare .
I will not be striven with .
Without the great ones of the white shrine hindering him at the Mesqet of the stars .
Do not hinder Unas!
"If Unas should be striven with, then Atum would be striven with ."
Neferekare will not be taken away to the king .
You will not take Pepi away .
There is no god who would take hold of Pepi .
Let them not take your hand to i .e . lead you to that house of that Ba .
Do not strand him!
Do not strand him!
Pepi will not be stranded .
And the son of Atum is not stranded .
Do not call upon the one who would strand Horus from his eye!
His arms are not weak .
He will not become feeble .
May she not wean you .
She will not wean him .
She will not wean you!
Let her not wean you .
They will never wean him .
"He will give him his Akh, who is ‘watcher of Buto .’"
"Horus foremost of his Menit, Satjuti, lord of Sebut, the jackal of Upper Egypt, the nome administrator of the great Ennead ."
"This twice great word gone forth from the mouth of Thoth to Osiris: ‘seal bearer of life, sealer of the gods .’"
"That he make you an Akh, as Thoth, as Anubis, noble of the court ."
How satisfying it is to hear Osiris the overseer of the gods arising!
"O jackal, nome administrator of the Ennead ."
"Arise, O one who is in Nedit!"
The one who is in Nedit is shaken .
"This Akh who is in Nedit comes, the power who is in the Thinite nome ."
So does the Akh who is in Nedit .
"As Osiris, this Ba who is in Nedit, this power who is in the great city ."

"O father of Pepi Osiris Pepi, whose sleep is great, great of inertness ."
O Osiris Neferkare .
They will perform service for Osiris Pepi .
This is a garment which Horus made for his father Osiris .
"This libation of yours, O Osiris, this libation of yours, O Unas, which went forth because of your son, which went forth because of Horus ."
O Osiris .
O Osiris .
"To the brow! To the brow, to Osiris!"
O Osiris .
"O Osiris, Ba who is among the Akhs, power who is in his offices, one whom the Ennead saves in the house of the noble ."
"They have come, only in seeking their brother Osiris, only in seeking their brother Pepi ."
O Osiris .
"This libation of yours, O Osiris, that which is in Busiris, and that which is in Geregubaf ."
O Osiris .
"O Osiris, Ba who is among the Akhs, power who is in his offices, one whom the Ennead saves in the house of the noble ."
Let this power be made an Akh because of his Ba .
"You are a god, the sole power ."
"As Osiris, this Ba who is in Nedit, this power who is in the great city ."
You being a power before the living .
May you be a power before the powers .
"He having given you his jackal Akhs, you being as Horus who is in his house, as the foremost one, foremost of powers ."
You being the power before the powers who are in you .
As the power foremost of powers .
This one is the power foremost of Akhs .
"Appear as Wepiu, as the Ba who is foremost of the living, as the power foremost of Akhs, as the sole star!"
"Appear as Wepiu, as the Ba foremost of the living, as the power foremost of Akhs!"
"Have power in your body as a god, as the Ba foremost of the living, as the power foremost of the Akhs!"
Adorn Unas as the lord of all of you!
Let Unas be protected there by those who see him .
He is protected from that which might be done against him .
The protection of Unas is my eye .
Neferkare is protected .
Cause that Unas be protected!
The protection of Unas is his protection .
Let Teshy protect Teti; let Teshy protect Teti .
Protect Teti; protect Teti!
The protection of Unas is his eye .
You will be pure for the new moon ceremony .
You will be pure at the monthly ceremony .
You will appear at the monthly ceremony: you will be pure at the new moon ceremony .
You will be purified for the new moon ceremony like the one who stands tirelessly .
And be pure .
May you release your impurity for Atum in Heliopolis .
May you be pure .
Be pure!
May you be pure .
May you be pure .

Be pure by them as a god!
"Which ferryboat, O Unas, should be brought to you?"
Where will you go?
Who are you?
From where have you ascended?
To where have you come?
Who has done this for you?
Who has done this for you?
Who has acted for you?
Raise one who is greater than you!
Let them raise you .
She who provides has raised you .
Let Geb raise you .
That she may raise you .
Let the foremost of Letopolis raise you .
That she may raise you .
Your body being round by it .
Behold: you are round and encircled as the round one who goes around the Haunebu .
"Be great and round, as the round one who goes around the Haunebu!"
" what you have , your body being round by it ."
"You more sacred than him, in your name of ‘he of the sacred land .’"
Go down be more sacred than him!
Go down and be more sacred than him!
That he be satisfied .
Geb has given you your eyes precisely that you be satisfied .
That he be satisfied with it .
Be satisfied with it!
That you may be satisfied .
Be satisfied with them!
Your sight is satisfied because of Horus .
And you are satisfied with the eyes of this great one in you .
"Precisely that you be satisfied, in your name of ‘satisfied Ka .’"
And be satisfied with it .
Be satisfied with it!
And be satisfied with it every day .
Let the followers of Horus satisfy you .
That it satisfy your heart .
"Unas is the siever of the gods, protector of the house of Re, born of Nehet netjeru, she who is in the prow of the bark of Re ."
"And set Merenre in his place, him being cleared and bearing a forked staff !"
"Pepi is the scribe of the god’s book, one who says what is, who brings about what yet is not ."
Being the scribe of Hathor and becoming the bull of Heliopolis .
That I be served .
Even that they serve Pepi .
"And they serve you, and so may you not suffer ."
"O one who thus passes the night, O great one, O one who spends the night thus ."
Neferkare thus passing the night with his Ka .
"O Neith, one who would rise up, who sleeps, who would be distant, who passes the night ."
"O Neith, great of sleep, who is greater of sleep than this great sleeper, O one who passes the night thus ."
"O Neferkare, great of Qeded sleep, great of Sedjer sleep, who sleeps thus, O great one, who thus passes the night ."
O one who passes the night thus .
Unas becoming the great one who is in Shedet .
That Unas may look upon you just as Sobek looks upon Neith .
"Unas is Sobek, green of plumage, vigilant of sight, who raises the brow ."
"And he passes judgment as Sobek who is in Shedet, as Anubis who is in Tabet ."
"For you are the sole star, the companion of Utterance ."
You are this sole star which ascends in the east of the sky .
So that you don the fillet as the sole star in the center of Nut .
And my father Osiris Pepi is this sole star in that eastern side of the sky .
"Appear as Wepiu, as the Ba who is foremost of the living, as the power foremost of Akhs, as the sole star!"
"Seize the Wereret crown as the sole star, the one who destroys enemies!"
"I having done for him what should be done as for i .e . he being the sole star, the one who has no equal among them, the gods ."
Seize the Wereret crown as the sole star who destroys enemies!
Neferkare is your son .
"For Merenre is Weneg, the son of Re, the one who shoulders the sky, who leads the earth, who judges the gods ."
"Merire is the son of Re, beloved of him ."
Pepi was conceived to Re .
Behold: thus am I your son .
For he is your own son forever .
Because Neferkare is the great steering oar who rows the Khatawi of the sky .
"Adorned of horn sharp and strong, as the one who bears the sharp knife, the cutter of throats ."
"Unas is stronger than them, is appeared upon his bank ."
"For Pepi is Thoth, mightiest of the gods ."
Your strength being greater than his .
O one great of strength .
With your strength greater than his .
For you are the Akh great of strength .
The strength of Pepi is the strength of Seth the Ombite .
Neferkare having become strong by your might .
"His face as this great one, lord of the diadem, one strong by what was injured in him ."
"His strength is in the horizon, like Atum his father who bore him ."
That he be strong by that by which you are strong .
"And have power as a god, as the successor of Osiris ."
"This going of yours, is as the successor of Osiris ."
"This going of yours, is as the successor of Osiris ."
With the day bark summoning him .
Let them make summons for Pepi .
Let the day bark summon Merenre .
And Geb has summoned him .
On this day of your being summoned in order to hear commands .
"Let Atum summon Pepi to the sky, for life ."
Even because you are the one whom Osiris put upon his throne .
He being appeared as the uraeus which is in the brow of Seth .
"His Isuti uraeus is the cobra which came forth from the god, the I’aret uraeus which came forth from Re ."
"Merenre is the uraeus which came forth from Seth, which is taken, which is brought ."
The uraeus which is in the brow of Re .
"Neferkare is a screeching falcon who circles around, the eye of Horus inside the netherworld ."
"This one is the cobra, who came forth from Re ."
"Neith is the falcon who came forth from Re, is the uraeus which came forth from the falcon, which came forth from the eye of Horus ."
"Descend, O Teti, as the jackal of Upper Egypt, as Anubis, the one upon his belly, as Wepiu, foremost of Heliopolis!"
Your arms are Wepiu .
"He has come, even as Wepiu ."
And receive your name of ‘Wepiu!’
That you go out through them as Wepiu .
"Descend as the jackal of Upper Egypt, as Anubis who is beside him, as Wepiu, foremost of Heliopolis!"
"Raise yourself, O child of Horus, as the child who is in Djebaut Buto, as Seth, the one who is in Henhenet!"

Cut your bonds as Horus who is in his house!
" as Horus, as the one who is in his house, as Seth who is in Henet!"
"Nu bore Merenre upon his left hand, even with him being young, knowledge of Merenre not existing ."
Teti is young .
He is a youth .
"Pepi is this youth, who is more hidden of form than the imperishable stars ."
Just as the heart of her son Horus was brought .
And I put your heart into lit . to your body for you .
And I give you your own heart .
Let Isis wail for you .
While the great mooring post wails for you as for Osiris in his suffering .

So that the god may depart to his action .

For the voice of Merenre is true .
The voice of the enemies of Pepi will not be true .
"Isis comes, even with her having grasped hold of her breasts for herself, for her son, true of voice ."
