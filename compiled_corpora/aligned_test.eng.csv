how will that land be without him
for i will let your expedition enter it
the officials who were appointed to eradicate falsehood
it goes down with him who does it to the necropolis
5 tjwn trees
when he was a child at his mothers breast
to the supports of heaven
and his great offering to one who is loyal to him
his appearance as chief of the two lands

and of those aboard none remained except myself
from fresh cedar from lebanon

lacuna in text
i have never seen the like of this goose
the king of upper and lower egypt two ladies
lead it for him who knows that you have come forth from him
the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperenre
in fact your possessions are in your house
until
he who measures heaps of corn is pilfering for himself
it was he who subjugated the foreign lands
yours is what the sun revolves around
only pupil of my palace
in our lifetime
it is the life that comes of giving him adoration
charged as tributes of the annual requirements
for chewing is without merit
your monuments are greater than those of any king who has been
whose heart led him astray to alien lands
and he was given ten loaves of bread and two jars of beer every day
and all good and pure things on which a god lives
southerners are going north
drove off their bulls
gold horus perfect of years who enlivens the hearts
and found him emerging from the gate of the temple of arsaphes
the residence l.p.h. was in silence
performing the rites for his father amun re
as for a temple day it is the three hundred and sixtieth part of the year
it severs the heads of the asiatics
you will become rejuvenated at home
breath of the mouth is beneficial to the blessed
his mucus is in his belly
to its entirety
another prince was appointed as sole companion
starting a good journey
a thousand of bread
how is it djedi that i havent been made to see you before
the first time the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperenre bestowed on me another favour
stop the barque
if i answer it
kings wife and kings mother tetisheri may she live forever
and the fields of khef her nebes
there is no tomb for him-who-rebels against his majesty
tore out their barley
and for monuments
i led the ignorant to what he didnt know
and the same was done for the whole crew
after he has spent many years
his noble father who loves him is preparing the way for him
it came to you by the gifts of the god
i defeated
for their blessed dead
dont act clever friend
examine me i am at a loss
overseer of the house
just as any royal nobleman
it was not in my heart
battle him in all his words
pass judgement yourself son of meru
the one who goes out under his kin is a miserable man
favour ahead of the ancestors
you were born to him
its large door from asian copper
horus mighty bull powerful in strength
to build monuments for my father osiris
the lord of the gods amun the lord of the thrones of the two lands
may he hear the prayer from afar
for which you your majesty had sent them
saying living death each day
they no longer had horses
every scribe
at every seasonal festival
officials are doing evil
numerous in gifts from the palace
rejoicing in strength and victory
pieces of wood from farafra
beloved of his city
and this peasant said
companion of horus
can a balance be crooked
you will prepare laxatives for him
when you are dead
who can be ferried across
be very welcome to me in peace sweet daughter who is in my heart
then they said to his majesty
noise in the southern sky
and washed my dirty linen
if you seek out the character of a friend
i will alight when you become weary
son of re of his body
if my soul listens to me
you should set yourself equal to these three
reception of the tribute of a prince of punt
year 8
overseer of works of aakheperenre peniati
if the face of this fall to the ground nut will fall to the ground
like re forever
you will not taste the evil of the river
look a wonder that happened
the overseer of works suti
the influence of a masculine pain demon
achievements of count khnumhotep
forever and ever
do not have sex with a child woman
and this peasant came to plead with him for a ninth time
do not act against yourself do not act against yourself anymore
and all your plans will fall into place
i endowed him with fields and servants
gold horus great of strength who smites the asiatics
then my majesty ordered that they be granted passage
his heart has obeyed the wish if only i had
although i was not talked about
land giving you to land
i countered their movements
it is not because of me
now the house of this nemtinakht was at a waterside path
royal seal keeper
thinking
they are the property of one for another
and they came in peace to karnak
ought me
an overflow he has assembled it of himself
praise for me endured in the palace
a hundred jars of beer
my house
for four days
about your beautiful arrival at my temple
the stone was dragged by bulls that asiatics brought
he created it as his monument for his father amun re
priesthood of the temple of this god
justified
he never hesitated at all
when the day dawned on which mankind would be slain
then he took a rod of fresh tamarisk to him
do not deviate but operate the rudder pull on the tiller rope

the king of upper and lower egypt nebtawire
at the lake of niya
for you block our path with your clothes

his good name will be in the mouths of the living
which didnt cease
do not scheme for what has not yet come
because his father amun loved him so much
son of re of his body tuthmosis shining like re given life
reaching him at nightfall
well considered in reason
now a message had been sent to the kings children
who created himself

he was a hero without equal
of resin incense and galena
keeper of all precious stones
when she was a child being breast fed
every dignity was conferred on him by the majesty of

mistress of mankind
what is it you expend to satisfy your dependants
he is eager when he sees the east
justified
dont become a flood against the suppliant
on me
had been sent to smite the foreign lands
my majesty commands that you be made to go south
and wrappings from tayet
do not make provision for the following day
and showed me the way to the cabinet
his majesty spent a day of celebration
how beautiful it is when a son receives what his father says
it is known
the revered singer tjeniaa
while he is happy on the horus throne
because of speech that you fear will bring reproof
then he spread it out on the waterside path
fine houses
whereas formerly the majesty of this noble god had been on eleven carrying poles
when the one who should bring about the deed is unwilling
who was well disposed to those who had nothing
beholding the nubians
after death i am buried in my tomb of the necropolis
like the smell of myrrh
son of the ruler of unet
he measured 30 cubits
as for the fool unable to hear
now he is a hero who acts with his own arm
speak justice and do justice
i reached the walls of my father
horus foremost of letopolis
overseer of the administration
if you meet an opponent in his moment
none are righteous
i met a man standing on the road
one whom we name son of the north wind
lord of silence may you give me back my things
more than sitting on sandbanks of crocodiles
for the spirit of
retjenu is under my feet
that man is getting away from this city
valiant montu on the battlefield
he is the great god
let me be brought twenty oars of ebony plated with gold
which his strong arm had attacked
and it is the high steward whom you are referring to
because i was brave
amun re lord of the thrones of the two lands
the influence of a god
sovereign l.p.h. my lord
female slave baket
the kings children who were following his majesty l.p.h.
put him on land for him to oppose himself
he intended to smite me
because heads have fallen in the water
glorious seed of the almighty
then you may reply when you are addressed
and djedi was ushered in to him
he knows how to make a lion walk behind him
the incense it belongs to me
who leaned on a child
i make happen what i conceive
while his complete expedition was behind him
from beautiful white limestone
begotten by count sobek nekhet justified
prince regent and count
for the life prosperity and health
one sleeps as a child every day
preparing to smite the egyptians
cows and labourers of offering of amun
there is no enemy of mine in the southern lands
southern boundary made in year 8 under the majesty of
including children
he is vengeful one who smashes heads
now i was standing by and heard his voice
horus of edfu great god lord of heaven may he give life
to plead with him for a third time
leading me to the road of horus
and made two guards turn against him with whips
he says
horus mighty bull beloved of maat
faithfulness to them assures success
investigating what was of old
aakheperkare given life
the commander in charge of the border patrol
creates a quarreler out of a cool temperament
terebinth balsam camphor
by a wave of the sea
you see her
chief of commanders
his southern boundary reaches to the crest of the world
first time of the hebset festival
who leaves under orders
kings daughter kings sister sovereign
i fill his house
it comes from my body because of the condition thereof
is without end
their guidance does not stray
it is the lone man that the god fosters
the mind has stopped and cannot remember the day before
in fat of pintail duck
offerings and sustenance
fowl
a thousand of bread beer
then i placed myself on my belly
to repel the rebellious lands
hail to you
with all good products that were brought
"hathor second month """" day 9 """""
his majesty slew him
tore out their barley
they are the flock that is good for their lord
i speak truthfully
to whom secret matters are told
do not be greedy over a share
he divided the great river along its middle
so the officials who hear may say
and i slept in a shelter of wood
by the grant of the king to me
rudder of heaven beam of earth
what this humble servant was afraid to say
wise
and friends of today dont love each other
every feast of the happy living and of the dead
he will conquer southern lands
the road that is walked upon
and two female slaves were given to me
whom can i talk to today
a good reward belongs to him who does it
i returned the sand to those who are upon it
concerning this flight
when the troglodytes fell to terror
flourishing of years in the great house of truth
the name of her father is yuia
the infantry was in joy
ignoramus look you are questioned
until his urine comes out
the hearer to whom it is said is effective in the body
and who will say
he executed a royal commission
and he went on to say to his majesty
how lamentable is the poor man you ruin
savior of the poor
a husband to the widow
like one who has not been ill
to what the sun revolves around
as the king loves you
her eye is her storm when it sees
in your everlasting tomb
the steward sees the daughter of the vizier on it
wives were jabbering
whom can i talk to today
leader of feather horn hoof and scale
revered
in this land in its entirety
who runs
one great of strength like the son of nut
dont listen to the heart
his name is not effaced on earth
i have come to you in order that i may break your water-pots
for the oldest prince ahmose justified
he who should relieve distress is ordering its creation
pulled by oxen
who knew what was said in every office
then he created magical protection for khons the provider in thebes
to the place where my majesty is
having gone from qedi to retjenu
their hearts are celebrating
then his majesty said
what my soul said to me
royal linen white cloth fine linen moringa oil
let your eye go that it may smite them for you
while your statues remained in the temple in the following of the great god
such is death
when will ruddjedet give birth
we will not again do evil against menkheperre
and this child rushed into her arms a baby of one cubit
and he was exceedingly happy
and the monuments of its burial place were more excellent
she will give birth on the fifteenth day of the first month of winter
since i had taken their horses
my father built for himself a mortuary chapel in mer neferet
and i overthrew the enemies of osiris
i was sent by my lord l.p.h.
horus beloved of re who appears with the white crown
all health all joy
and they said our stroke has become still without rowing
since one cannot know what is going to happen in it
behold three children have been born to thee
to whom people have told their matters

then he said to me

nebkaure justified
when the construction of this was being done

i was parched and my throat was dry
the heart is weary
and this djedi said welcome welcome hordedef
so that you may enjoy them
his moment cannot fail to come
it seemed to him like heaven
the glance of man had not fallen upon it
then she heard the noise of singing music making dancing cheering
there is no falsehood
ten men came and ten men went
and his majesty said
but there is no straight way in for the one who fails to hear
and slept on a bed
he is a king valiant like montu
it puts resentment of it in place of love of it
but not for cheating
then the high steward rensi son of meru accused

refreshing under his sycamores
acclaimed for his rising and setting

because of the difficult stone on the ground
prince regent and count
they will perform this magisterial office in this entire land
and one of them was called

i was a leader of leaders
there will be no rebel against you in what heaven surrounds
his majesty arriving to kill the enemies of the vile kush
given life forever
he placed himself on his belly saying
greeting o prince
and children
and my staff was of ebony decorated with electrum
horus mighty bull appearing in truth
words to be said four times
there is no boast
their shrines had fallen into decay
one cannot know what is in the heart
and she became well instantly
this nemtinakht then said

son of re tuthmosis
his majesty appeared on the dais
as bread and beer for every day
the light of the uraeus is your protection
a well was found in the middle of the valley
excellent in speaking
who didnt turn magistrates into servants
and give you eternity without limit
the temple that his majesty built
i crossed maati
if he wanders and breaks your advice
the humble man who returns
my lady why are you in this mood
you did not speak when your name was pronounced
respect him according to what he has become
there was a man called khunanup
adoration of amun
youths from east unet
my heart being my companion
you are here and you will stay with me
and khnum made his limbs healthy
and protects him while he sleeps
may she live
without loss to our expedition
son of re
and asiatics will not bury you
beloved of the king
among the children of the ruler of vile kush
second month of the season of inundation day 23
patricians were wailing
than your corpse being buried
its voice would be like someone thirsty behind a well
united with the sun
by establishing his goodness with it on earth
and one might know the excellence of his majesty
to live in a foreign land
may i hear the messages of her children
i built for him a splendid neshmet barque
the singer neferhotep
and the fear of you wouldnt permit appealing to you
with my body at home
those who are subject to the lord of the two lands
when you go down in the western mountain
i have been forseeing it for these many years
see the scribe is listening to this advice
to no effect
what is pray the thing which thou hast done to it
finding him by his majesty
i placed your two sisters as protection behind you
then the kings children were ushered in
to let you be brought
i shall have them bring you ladanum malabathrum
the loud mouthed is an evil on the heart
beware of the approach of eternity
in accordance with the utterance of the lord of the gods amun
saviour of one who has none
i will not let you take him from me
he is atum at the tying of necks
foremost of those in the west
bent on doing what he wants
are you a thief
all sorts of fine things
sehotepibre has gone to the horizon
whose lips are sealed about what he hears
then my majesty ordered that they be made to swear an oath
great one of the king of upper egypt
and he said high steward my lord
a good son
there was no accusation against me
his majesty did this
and let there be given one cake one jug of beer
decree from the kings mother to the prince regent
i am one who was good
and presented them to his majesty
given life like re forever and ever
think of your corpse and return
and one turns to a stranger
their forms were made secret and sacred
as you wish that osiris is merciful to you
of someone whose eyes have the bjdj disease
now the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt cheops justified spent the day
and his majesty fell into a bad mood at this
two ladies prosperous of years
and overseer of the granaries of amun
one ox and two balls of incense
i was given gold of valour
the first divine council of the flood
bakhtan is your home
i captured their women
and i go out by day
with ointment of white fronted goose
set fire to it
the scribe ineni justified
on a fishing day
and every kind of precious stone
as they came to engage my majesty
it entangles the wife and the man
affection will be for the one who passes him
as i was standing in the middle of my tribe
for the scribe ahmose
and he said to them come in
i slew him with my axe
and every good thing from the gods land
oxen
and his fate brought on his doom
the singer tjeniaa says
who made the plan for the masses
then you will say
true and beloved acquaintance of the king follower sinuhe says
overseer of the city vizier ptahhotep
at the 12 monthly feasts and the 12 mid monthly feasts
justified
son of amun
look you are a cook whose joy is to slaughter
my heart led me to serve the king
it happened when i wasnt there
then there was more fighting in this place
this god then went to the place where bentresh was
called userhat amun
a righteous man whose righteousness has crumbled
the lands say
mistress of happiness
i was a speaker in situations of anger
so that you could crush the contentious and deceitful
i was not talked about in my presence
who replies to a matter as befits it
she appointed me as scribe of the divine seal keeper
overseer of the administration
years were made to vanish from my body
and cast aside my misery
sustenance
and may fear of you resound
and caught sight of bedouin
and unseen by the bearers of the two ladies
they come to her with fearful heart
and the loved man for whom a city is founded
you race a course
for fear of being seen by
then i carried off his property
i taught every craft that had been forgotten
ruddjedet had a quarrel with the maid
and administered her a nasty blow
he slew seven lions by shooting in an instant
when a levy is decreed to take place
that keeps them alive
why is it that you have come here
their skulls flooded their valleys
but he cant hear her
he should stand on yonder side
considering what would be beneficial to the deceased
until you have completed four months on this island
i said this to you
the opponent is born out of impoverishment
and touched the ground before him
he let me smite all foreigners
given life forever until eternity
among their days of travelling south
and they washed him after his umbilical cord had been cut
and he ruled on the throne of his begetter
make your libation vessels abundant
with the courtiers
but thats when the sandbanks of two fish canal are cut off
he made me round up herds of elephants
he made it something greater than itself
will find no difficulty in being a messenger in reporting
to a plot of land north of the residence
join with your majesty in your hearts
that comes forth from the mouth of re himself
myrrh is mine
then he said to her
i speak to you
he gave me the land in its length and its breadth
oil
the banks are cheering and exulting
bring me personnel of the academy
which month lord of thebes desires to live forever
a mistress of command
the king of upper and lower egypt djeserkare gave me
i found it was a serpent coming
because of the greatness of the might of her father amun
and everything that is done for a king in the room
the man endures whose guideline is right
i stole away leaping to find myself a hiding place
founded upon the praise of his perfection
with vine
who guides my majesty on the good road
the spoken word is more persistent than weed
while the captives were dragged in
if you show mercy on a past failure
may you bring myrrh apply ointment
there is flint in the box in the room called inventory in heliopolis
and letting a man attend his truly good cause
what has come to your mind
may he live forever
all your conduct will move forward

their utterances concerned the praises and favours towards me
sitting in the council of his master
i stretched out my own hands
so take care that he doesnt drown
i have ordained it to you long ago
the scribe ineni justified
not a soldier retreated
who lives in djed snofru
we cross over when the scribe sends
good at listening
why do you act against yourself
it is filled with offerings and sustenance
i spent many years as count of hierakonpolis
from khons in thebes neferhotep
look his majesty has appointed you as the chief steward
now my majesty travelled to the ends of asia
keeper of the diadem
and one did as everything that his majesty had ordered

the bedouin of asia are subject to my majesty
and meanwhile his wife and his children

purify yourself in his name
it has been a long time of roaming the earth
as you wish that your city gods praise you
he has conquered through love
and forget worries
with a pedestal of silver
it is that there is fright in my body
but if you shut your eyes to the impudent

i didnt know whether i was dead or alive
i placed myself between two bushes
as commander of his army
then it is ground
