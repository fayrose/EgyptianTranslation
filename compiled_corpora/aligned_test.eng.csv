his bones were strong his limbs were destined to be of gold
after i had evaded his weapons
then ruddjedet became pure in a purification of fourteen days
do not waver that causes your expulsion
and went to heaven
then the maid said to the people in the household
look i shall take away your donkey peasant

i was a dutiful administrator of your monuments
and they returned to the house
elevated according to their offices
i was not haughty before

your condition is like that of one who lives before the infirmity of old age
i was one who exact in the house of his lord
we cross over when the scribe sends
your monuments are greater than those of any king who has been
high steward to the kings mother
no wave will carry you off
strong
as he has brought himself
without there being anyone to protect them
i was one who was firm

then he created magical protection for khons the provider in thebes
then let us make a habitation together
the arbitrator is a cheat
he placed me

perish in a pond surrounded at night by crocodiles
after you have placed two bowls on the fire
lead it for him who knows that you have come forth from him
whose great ones have one greater
who sees to eternity
i kept alive the names of my forefathers
i was appointed as overseer of the granaries
he has been eating bread and drinking beer
follower of the palace
and found bentresh possessed by a spirit
while his father was within his palace
then this peasant said to this wife of his

you are a father to this town
seeking for himself these chambers of the sanctuary of thoth
i was a follower who followed his lord
he said
the west is celebrating
we belong to him
put my name in the mouth of your servants
a creeping man creeps because of hunger
and polished my weapons
do not halt him until his belly is emptied
at the coming of his majesty
which sheds its flame in fire and emits its fragrance
accompanied by my troop of recruits
listen to me
but can be found with the women at the grindstone
or any poor man
your equal a man from your levels
whose radiance creates light
given life like re eternally
said by the man of the elite foremost of arm
then his majesty said
he has filled the two lands with the trees of life
my eldest son was in charge of my tribe

as for him who sails with it
may your tongue be truthful
and every man is stealing things from his fellow
carved out of the mountain on the western side of the euphrates
he is her father
and friends of today dont love each other
it is the bread of sharing that causes envy
my mace overthrew the asiatics
are you a thief then
in order to see it
if you are concerned about life
he who should dispel weakness is acting corruptly
and the air of heaven is breathed when you say so
she gave bread to the poor man after she found him on the street of this city
the utterance of a man saves him
the tongue of people is their stand balance

why do you act against yourself
the overseer of works suti

this humble servant is in the hands of one who cares for him
he did more for me than others before
the barbarians flee before him
in the place of judgement
with excellent plans
