are you not a man
has the house been prepared
the keeper of the diadem
reception of the tribute of a prince of punt
makes everyone laugh by his evil wrongdoing
like the skys clearing
and they put the barley in a sealed room
and justice was established in its place
who enters to report
so that its hem came to rest on the water
and was very frightened
the name of this canal is
osiris nurse of the gods wife rai
for doing is more useful to the doer than to the one for whom it is done
tarried for me
which i couldnt count
true image of love
the words of the officials follow it
one to whom the listeners listen
so that he keeps speaking remain silent
perhaps it is a peasant of his who went to someone else beside him
my plea is long and the division is difficult
when his majesty was in naharina according to his annual custom
they brought things the like of which had not been brought
and this peasant said
hedge plants
then who will repel evil
these 3 children
everyone
anyone fully fluent in speaking
when goodness is good goodness is good indeed
charitable
aakheperkare may he live forever
and clothes end nakedness
one will slaughter for you at the entrance of your tomb
then i brought away two female slaves as booty
two ladies who repeats birth
following a statue of 13 cubits of stone
clothing
in your hereditary offices
divine king going forth on the day of victory like month
then there was more fighting in this place
food cannot be brought to town
he who is nothing
and protector of his children
may you let the oath be established
they were given to friends of his
ra is in another place
uproar in the northern sky
an intimate friend is lacking
to report to the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt cheops justified
a king who is lauded for his arms in battle
i repelled those who rebel against the neshmet barque
all of the possessions of the temple are in their proper places when the priest commanded its inspection
let me be given one of the barges
that is at the sacred mountain
like a ship without a captain
assigned to the mortuary priest
he will stay close to me on the day of suffering
because he loved him so much
to have this sleeping potion poured out
after you have placed two bowls on the fire
as he governs his two lands
two ladies divine of birth
another favour granted to me
but it is not gathered in
born of khyt
he will not gibber with terror
may you grant me old age in your city
or the influence of anything bad
and swallowed for four days
and to let them see your majesty as shooting star
free of carelessness
there is no cow that can be tied to the wall
he of edfu great god lord of heaven
no success of theirs came about at all
and produce a son in the favour of god
your ship will not lag
horus who repeats birth
for my majesty sends you
on account of a little natron and a little salt
the sounding rod is in your hand
then his majesty said
on the soil of thebes and tawer
the servant of the king will have revered status
son of re tuthmosis shining like re
as he sailed southward to khent hen nefer
look he is arriving
speaker of truth
divine state
oxen
in whose belly urine is constricted
content in the place of eternity
as you will pass to blessedness
one would snare for me
his daughter satsobek
whose southern borders reach to the crest of the world
lady in waiting
none of them offered resistance
you are the king who took possession of the two lands hatshepsut
i repelled those who rebel against the neshmet barque
with his heart in accord with mine
the one with powerful arm who tramples his enemies
good lord i report to you concerning the daughter of the prince of bakhtan
incapable of communication
who tramples all rebellious foreign lands
he was a hero without equal
a bathroom divine images of the horizon
raised by bedouin
and who have not been opened by childbirth
musicians preceding you
these things which i have given to these priests
leader of everything in this entire land
with mut hathor
so may re lord of the two lands be gracious to you
then this god nodded approvingly to his prophet saying
and of the gods and goddesses
without pause in your labour
when every saying has been brought
who sent my majesty to seize the lands and all foreigners together
that is what is overlooked in the sight of the greedy
in the necropolis
his lips are reliable when he is speaking
fowl
he chose me from his city
i decked the chest of the lord of abydos
who creeps in
a sure marksman
i directed the works on the neshmet barque
excellent horus in the palace
this humble servant seeks counsel from his god
two living men and three hands
of silver two battle axes
is it the truth what they say
so that everyone sees
to the house of khons in thebes neferhotep
1/8 leaf of reed
not a man perished
for his father min of koptos
sole companion
it is not an act of people
because of letting its choice offerings be given
he wouldnt come at all
disclosing to them the unexplored roads
as i have seen an example of his learning
his majesty didnt halt
then this army of his majesty overthrew these foreigners
but shy fish will come to you
while i was on my belly before him
and gave him very many gifts of every good thing
my anguish leads to separation
i speak to you
while his majesty was in thebes
under the majesty of
and had her punished with a beating
and despoiled his encampment
after him riding on this chariot
the father sent his son to another place when he saw that bad man at the entrance of his house
dont be heavy you havent been light
i said i do not know him
i inundated a pond
in writing
then let us make a habitation together
avoid the instant of sloth
i lifted my heart and collected myself
without him knowing
and cast aside my misery
the son who listens to his father is good when he is a child
she who comes from the darkness
let his chariot go back to egypt
bringing of every good thing from the palace l.p.h.
then ruddjedet said
magnifying his victories to let his valour be related
his name was nemtinakht
hedge plants
the house is in the city
but it is a sweet breath from your entrails
this peasant then said
follower of the palace
no eye had seen it
much feared
by the goddess
that we may live on the breath that he gives
although i was not talked about
who drives his flock
the sea people hearing your battle cry
and i overthrew all his enemies
in captivity
and their people were brought away as captives
mankind then conspired against him
so that i need not scream
i damaged his towns and his people
relying on the numerous troops
for goods do not come of their own accord
in a brief day
count
and he ruled the banks of horus
how fine is this house of yours
that woman whose brother is a scribe
my name reeks through you
look he is a god on earth
then this nemtinakht said
beloved of atum lord of heliopolis
a good ruler who does what is beneficial to his father and all gods
together with everyone in bakhtan
to expel
with my arms
he slew seven lions by shooting in an instant
the king of upper and lower egypt nebpehtire justified
relieve the distress
amun the great god
another remedy for curing
i let them be guarded and protected for my forefathers
a funeral procession will be held for you
i kept alive the name of my father upon them
his eye had not yet been afflicted
and of the ennead mistresses of thebes
after this tomb had been finished
and crossed the water carrying him
may you live like re
who saw the face of khenty
having overthrown his enemies .]
words to be spoken
how joyful is this land that he rules
it is his serpent diadem that overthrows them for him
who purifies the place of the great ennead
he who is knowledgeable like re
for we have seen his might
spread awe of him every day
after he had exercised kingship
while he let egypt be in its state
on the first occasion
a mother who has given birth may be less happy than a maid
two ladies lord of the two lands
to plead with him
under whose seal the two gold houses are
his foremost deed was adorning his city
the king of upper and lower egypt maatkare
menits vessels collars
who saves from the west
to hathor mistress of punt
how good it is for the palace
to establish his monument in this land
of ebony and pure ivory
look i shall take away your donkey peasant
let his chariot go back to egypt
horus who repeats birth
of what he had planned to have said
the fisherman ravages the river
again a wonder happened
making for him a resting place of eternity
and it acquired all kinds of things
at the coming forth of the hm ntr priest
in his heart i was beneficial
high steward
and to punish the robber
revered
drinking water from the watering place
there was no enmity towards me
and said
the west is a harbour
for whose creation the souls of heliopolis assembled
every man knows his regulations
retjenu is under my feet
and fled quickly to their town
and my ams mace smited the nine bows
he then awoke in fear
his attack having succeeded with valour and strength
they gave praise to the lord of the two lands
hearts are greedy
who took the crowns in chemmis
i conduction the great procession
and trample those in the districts of the gods land
kings daughter kings sister
prince regent
bull stout hearted as he enters the arena
to the chief lector priest ubainer
who follows this king in his strides
and passed in ascending and descending
oxen
decimation of your birds
then the high steward rensi son of meru sent a message
the inhabitants of the aegean sea and the rebellious lands
now they had brought their menits their sistra
then the choice joints shall be removed from the altars of the gods
if it is crooked then you must be crooked
and will not forsake you
and all good things of the palace
beware of officials
then one woman who was at the stroke oar got entangled in her braids
it is great it is enduring
they were more beautiful than that which had existed formerly
and he has come to plead with me about it
to slay the inhabitants of libya
the king of upper and lower egypt djeserkare justified
and sustenance
with limitless people and horses
to other kings of lower egypt
copy of the reply to this decree written by

the prince regent
in front of the temple from granite .]
it is like i am ignored
i equipped the barque
on the day of the wag feast
i made for myself this tomb it being consecrated and its place being embellished at the staircase of the great god
the villain is an intimate friend
in valour and strength
and their arms grew strong
the schemers of evil

while this expedition of the king was watching

overseer of the granaries of amun

the aggressive man ends up in trouble
yet you have become a transgressor
and strewed it over my chest
do not raise your voice peasant
and accept it as a tip
let an offering be made of a thousand loaves of bread
beetle who raised himself
and joined him whom he had come from
the king of upper and lower egypt menkheperre
saying
horus mighty bull perfect of births
over whom nemti rejoices
given vent to what was on my mind
ra crosses the heavens in his great sacred barque
and the festivals of the seasons
since your eye is on those who scheme against you
ships were manned and laden with riches
a man on the rise
all foreign lands were united standing prepared to fight as one
and he was brought to him immediately
i showed valour in his presence at the cataract
but prepare for me the six heqat of barley
so that you may do her every good deed in the necropolis
who controls every foreign land
that you sanctify the foremost of those in the west
now what is said is that
or in these members of mine
his majesty ordered the creation of monuments for his father amun re
it is finer than anything in this land
but a good hearing is soothing for the heart
a bowl of silver
the ennead in the great temple
at the entrance of your tomb
and his scalp of real lapis lazuli
be very welcome to me in peace sweet daughter who is in my heart
may hearing enter him and all sincerity
i will go to petition on account of you to anubis
one man and three women altogether four people
the enemy staggers because of its might

all their coats of mail
one cannot distinguish truth from falsehood
helmsman dont let your ship go off course

all of this is important for someone who has roamed the earth
great god
but he couldnt find any
setting aside offerings for them as daily sacrifices
divine nest of horus
who is great of strength in battle
who will enter this tomb
dignitary
and they said to his majesty
i will not be turned back by the door keepers of the gates of the west
and he said to her
with noble name in all foreign lands
his majesty commanded the digging of this canal after his finding it blocked up with stones
then he addressed his son
she filled my hut with silver and gold
whose plans do not fail
i made all festival offerings for him
then that enemy and the princes who were with them had sent
who finds the right words
director of works at the rock tomb of the king
stonemasons artisans
sem priest with clean fingers
and said high steward my lord
my ways are good
justified
the king of upper and lower egypt menkheperre may he live forever
a constriction of urine
you will spend month upon month
my ladies look there is a woman who is suffering
all people
if you are concerned about life
given life
and there was none who dared approach me
who smashes the heads of the evil minded
his majesty appeared on a chariot
beginning of a remedy for curing
one constructs there for the palace l.p.h.
the west is celebrating
year 50 first month of the season of harvest day 22
more than the smell of bird droppings
since the followers of horus
the reach of a nurselings mouth for milk
he is a brave king an excellent fortress to his army
or the influence of anything bad
a servant of the royal thrones
i let you hear
you having been placed in a hearse
and this child rushed into her arms a baby of one cubit
while he has pain in his stomach
dont be negligent act at the accusation
eldest horus within lower heaven
i was given five people
he created it as his monument for his father amun
and the entire land is under his feet

if you delay telling me who brought you to this island
exotic goods from the land of punt
and one who should lead has gone astray
son of re tuthmosis
the inhabitants of the aegean sea
i levied their troops of young men
having captured southerners and northerners
like a mans grasping thereby
fine houses
by the overseer of the works of amun suti
my statues were placed in the temple in the following of the great god offerings having been established for them their offering bread having been fixed in writing
if you are concerned about life
and restrains me from death
and robs only that
how lamentable is the poor man you ruin
i overthrew them as he ordered in the way that he used to do
of green gold from amu
anyone who comes and supplies to him is his brother
i found figs and grapes there
this means that he who twists speech from its correct sense
excellent speaker in the opinion of the king
foster his image in the sight of people
may the same be done for you
i gave more than what other kings did
they arrived safely in thebes
with lapis lazuli and turquoise
brave shepherd
that is in this body of mine
at the lake of niya
concerning this flight
foremost of those in the west
the standards thereof were of electrum
to be mixed
but then they said to him
the good god lord of rituals menkheperre
or the season of inundation
the one who did justice
he opened his mouth to me
the name of this canal is
beholding a stable with bulls oxen calves
my heart was not in my body
it goes down with him who does it to the necropolis
and finally he rewarded the chief lector priest djadjaemankh
heaven and earth are flooded by incense and
the sun shines in the daytime
without crowds behind him
follower of the palace
who brought it on the course of restoration
provision your altars
in whom there is no falsehood
he is one who disables without showing his back
a magnificent hall was built for him
i brought its tributes to the lord of the two lands
from the prow of the falcon ship of his majesty
the sight of the one who enters to report is keen
they could foretell a gale before it came
having viewed what i have experienced
the scribe loved
every man is robbing his fellow
such has never happened to former kings
whom he loved
be precise in the form he sent you
unseen unheard
he killed 120 elephants in the foreign country of niya
in whose heart a matter doesnt slumber
while his forefathers are celebrating
a large portion of meat and one ball of incense
he is the son of osiris
while i do not listen to him
a man leaves his land because of nakedness
they are the lords of heaven
his words are heard
leader of the city
under the majesty of
one sets the standard after you
his wife says to him
so they are good too for burial
if it is a hand balance
i set out early when it was day
i inundated a pond

bowing to your majesty as i commanded
whose great ones have one greater
i did not devise it
and it is the hand balance that detects deficiency
every treasure of the treasury
foreigners supplicate together
he appointed me to be count in the year 19 in menat khufu
then the prince of bakhtan went on to report to his majesty saying
as someone far from his majesty who inquires
it will go well for you here with me
and i followed the god in his steps
you should not do

they advanced their hearts being bold
as he reports the words of the king to his nobles

with a ship or any herds of the nubians
welcome in peace hathor who helped the creator
who subjugates the lands at the ends of the world
and he sees the darkness of a north wind arise
"renenutet third month """" day 9 """""
horus of edfu great god lord of heaven may he give life
you never know what may displease
and this peasant came to plead with him for a fourth time
by a wave of the sea
our land we have reached it
he multiplied their alters with gold silver bronze and copper
i commanded a mortuary offering
of good limestone
but look your donkey
so that he will feel well immediately
year 1 fourth month of the season of inundation day 19
there is no limit to what became mine in victory
there is no other before him
as you wish to see me in health
the first time the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperenre bestowed on me another favour
that foreign land
this peasant then went south to herakleopolis
lord of abydos
he said praised one
but if it expels itself
while proceeding to the land of djahi
may he live forever
who builds monuments on his own initiative for his father amun
gold horus mighty of being
hearts are greedy
who cannot be turned away
about whom a lie has been told involving a man
and the helm is in your hand
another remedy for making a child urinate
i have overpowered mankind
as you do this your bodies will be well
may he live forever
that one should oppose your utterances
my majesty did this
he remains as lord
in return for many payments
she did everything that a queen should do
do not overwhelm the field labourer with work
then this peasant came
the poor man who spoke with his true heart was found
good god

how will that land be without him
for i will let your expedition enter it
and i induced cheers in the western deserts
to the hall keeper imenyankhren

and his great offering to one who is loyal to him

only pupil of my palace
in our lifetime
to the kings who were before
charged as tributes of the annual requirements
to adorn his mysteries with the electrum
your monuments are greater than those of any king who has been
then his majesty said to him
whose heart led him astray to alien lands
now afterwards
southerners are going north
drove off their bulls
gold horus perfect of years who enlivens the hearts
who hastens
the residence l.p.h. was in silence
may your majesty send a learned man to see her
and to let them see your majesty as a crocodile
when the prince regent and count nakht son of khnumhotep justified and revered petitioned
you will become rejuvenated at home
breath of the mouth is beneficial to the blessed
his mucus is in his belly
the influence of a masculine pain demon the influence of a feminine pain demon
another prince was appointed as sole companion
starting a good journey
a thousand of bread
as to all which is in writing on the papyrus-roll hear it
and the fear of you wouldnt permit me to appeal to you
stop the barque
and the fields of khef her nebes
then his majesty said
tore out their barley
and for monuments
and protect the poor
in order to reach for a life as you described
that is what they do
for their blessed dead
dont act clever friend
examine me i am at a loss
after i had been honoured before his courtiers

for which you your majesty had sent them
saying living death each day
they no longer had horses
every scribe
officials are doing evil
numerous in gifts from the palace
rejoicing in strength and victory
and he restored what he found ruined
seeing the monuments of their lords
how bad things are for me
companion of horus
i was one who was calm with the angry
you will prepare laxatives for him
is there not a pavilion in the garden of ubainer
then this army of his majesty arrived in vile kush
when you are dead
the primeval one of the two lands
and stand at the tomb shaft on the day of burial
then they said to his majesty
and let me be brought twenty nets
noise in the southern sky
and washed my dirty linen
if you seek out the character of a friend
and the city was gathered rejoicing

and all your plans will fall into place
as a mission of the king
gold horus great of strength who smites the asiatics
justified
then my majesty ordered that they be granted passage
his heart has obeyed the wish if only i had

i countered their movements
it is not because of me

the stone was dragged by bulls that asiatics brought

now it was the majesty of this august god
this woman listens to the scribe
offerings and sustenance
my majesty commands that you be made to go south
creator of all
and showed me the way to the cabinet
a greedy man is without achievement
the norm of speech is biased
who knew which phrase could make people angry
the revered singer tjeniaa
while he is happy on the horus throne
then he spread it out on the waterside path
fine houses
whereas formerly the majesty of this noble god had been on eleven carrying poles
when the one who should bring about the deed is unwilling
all that he gave to me
vice chairman of the cabinet
beholding the nubians
like the smell of myrrh
may khons defend me a true scribe
as for the fool unable to hear
speak justice and do justice
horus foremost of letopolis

retjenu is under my feet
that man is getting away from this city
as they came to engage my majesty
he is the great god

because i was brave
turquoise and every kind of herb from the gods land were on their backs

dont disregard someone you know
the kings children who were following his majesty l.p.h.
his heat scorches more than the flame of the torch
because heads have fallen in the water
and placed his eldest daughter before them praising his majesty

now i was standing by and heard his voice
horus of edfu great god lord of heaven may he give life
to plead with him for a third time
leading me to the road of horus
and made two guards turn against him with whips
may you present them to me pure and immaculate
investigating what was of old
