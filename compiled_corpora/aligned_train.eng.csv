there is no artist whose talent is fulfilled
may they give a mortuary offering
i was not talked about in my presence
so that he will feel well immediately
to widen the borders of thebes
then my majesty ordered that they be made to swear an oath
i built for him a splendid neshmet barque
he says
the cultivator of wickedness is watering his garden with evil
with a target of hammered copper
and countless of all kinds of cattle
after you have placed two bowls on the fire
the schemers of evil
and has brought you to this island of the spirit
the approach hall follows regulations
ready for battle in a narrow defile
a resting place
beloved of atum lord of heliopolis

but i was like a man in the dusk
or will you be a man of eternity
trees fall

i will let your majesty hear a wonder that happened in the time of your forefather snofru justified
lord of life
a thousand of sustenance
at the necropolis
their gods bringing life and happiness
on which the lord of all reposes
in the temples of upper egypt
everyone is in joy when they hear it
free of carelessness
since i had taken their horses

i dont know what separated me from the place
do not constrain the desire of one who is laden down
she has no antagonists among the northerners
and one did as everything that his majesty had ordered

the first in heaven the second on earth
to abydos in tawer
possessor of geese numerous in birds
for whom there is no escape from the west
he distinguished me more than the great ones of the palace
this island to which one must come

all wood is splintered like a papyrus reed
and who have not been opened by childbirth
he then fetched it and gave it to its owner
i will drink water at the watering place
of myrrh malabathrum
no wrongdoing by me was found
overseer of the works
it is the one who exceeds his field who comes unstuck
only on account of his lord
and reusre will give them compensation for it after he returns

in his favour
on that day of great combat
i overthrew them as he ordered in the way that he used to do
that comes forth from the mouth of re himself
the people retreat from him
revere the bee adore his white crown
it is his serpent diadem that overthrows them for him
and its selvage on the barley
this is what keeps her in your house
giving plants so that he may be given life
then this peasant said
and the mother of my father
as the king is rejuvenating in your lives
horus divine of being
this is what they had come with
faces are blank
if the son of a someone receives what his father says
until this good god
of osiris
then he addressed his son
on the day they proceeded to the temple
nor do you give me a reward for this good speech
and stand at the tomb shaft on the day of burial
who will damage its inscriptions
my pyramid of stone was built
her majesty praised me
two ladies who praises atum shining of appearances
and man a ship with all beautiful women from inside your palace
it are the fishermen of elephantine who will dig out this canal every year
count
your avarice will befool you
who is among the gods
and djedi said

with lapis lazuli and turquoise
the good god who seizes with his arm
ramesse beloved of amun

i halted on an island of kemur
mankind then conspired against him
of ebony and pure ivory
then re said to nun
but look what you are doing is supporting the thief
and it cannot row
they know that i am their lord
i was one who was kind without haste
the man is in another place
who was ruler of upper retjenu
in an hour at the time of breakfast
whether i am at home or in this place
then he took a rod of fresh tamarisk to him
that he might celebrate millions of sed festivals
lord of the thrones of the two lands
hundreds of thousands of the finest of all foreign lands

my eyes are heavy
now i have spoken out against the aggressor
the fear of his majesty is in this land
his majesty sailed northward
and will not forsake you
one cannot stand near him
leucoma in the eyes
i renovated this tomb of the kings daughter
because he loved justice so much
the princes of every foreign land came bowing in peace
and the monuments of its burial place were more excellent
they strike down his opponents for him
birds of pray above this were numerous
horus mighty bull appearing in truth
to other kings of lower egypt
and dismiss the west
they brought things the like of which had not been brought
and every good thing from the gods land
he executed a royal commission
but the high steward rensi son of meru remained silent
who will see
to whom people were sent to ask for advise
the walls ordained by the lord of all
and his belly is stiff because of it
divided its ground plan
my son my avenger menkheperre may he live forever
securing what is right is the life of your children
arriving safely in the land of punt
when i heard the bellowing of cattle
within this city
the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperkare
when they saw the beauty of the neshmet barque
faithfulness to them assures success
magistrate at the head of the people
i will not let you hurt him
as your king loves you
i was stretched out on my belly
his daughter saw him
with them
the palanquin was set down
men from the pick of the entire land
to make his complaint
does the cow reproduce for the hard man
a message to let you know that
who reaches the ends of the earth every day
a castle of iron
weakness has overtaken me
son of re amenophis ruler of thebes
the chamberlain sobekdjedju
was made sole companion
they had not imagined the things i did
but who is there is a wise man
has the ferry sunk
as the king loves you
more than the creeks of marshes they have fished
said by
a libation vase of gold
who wont let an unemployed person through at once
they were in the valley of qina
from great to small
within this city
whom can i talk to today
it is commissioning something from a craftsman
the haker festival
together with these gods
look you are a ferryman who ferries across anyone who has the fare
who shall disturb them
then he made a great offering
hail to you as to the mistress of all
that keeps them alive
priest of horus and pakhet
a command was issued
sacred image of amun
and warms all who are chilled
then this nemtinakht said
i am before you
never had it been done since the time of king snofru the justified
mortuary priests were given to me
it that-of-thirty cubits
it will mean he is called a fool
i found it was a serpent which was coming
as for the principal who arrives with wrongdoing
and another was rubbing his feet
and this peasant had him report back
when he found him
in his neck
lo he was a beneficent son
which were assigned
the bearded people of the gods land i placated them for your sake
falling in heaps
bent on doing what he wants
may he be given life like re eternally
i was in the favour of his majesty every day
great in his rank
he was a falcon of gold and flew to the sky toward egypt
wives were jabbering
with water on all sides
now my body is full of misery
now may your majesty command that he be made to bring
as you wish that osiris is merciful to you
this nemtinakht to the officials who were with him
and that on which the sun shines
you trample all foreign lands
may he give his favour to one who acts faithfully to him
and the leaders with them were learned
his majesty came in joy
am i his companion
two ladies divine of birth
for chewing is without merit
he is the heir of every god
a royal offering of osiris
making him go to bakhtan
i followed
two ladies great of terror
lord of the throne of the two lands at his beautiful feast of luxor
because of the greatness of the might of her father amun
he will not be guilty
subverter of the law destroyer of rectitude
how like to her it is!
a brother to the divorced
you have come to us to be merciful to us
sailing on the sea
since the time of the god
this scribe speaks to that woman
and who explored its every way
so that evil doesnt reach you
beloved and given life like re
my majesty ordered the creation of the great ennead
he who was formerly a messenger now sends another
for doing is more useful to the doer than to the one for whom it is done
i stole away leaping to find myself a hiding place
the king of upper and lower egypt khakaure
while proceeding to the land of djahi
he got to know the excellence of my mind
another prince was appointed as sole companion
my ways are good
watch over your ka priests
that keeps them alive
god punishes with the same
water issued from the roughness of the stone
gods of gold
as perished as those who have never been
he who gives his breath to one who follows him
to the priests of abydos
in the third month of the season of inundation day 16
my majesty has seen them
how fine is this house of yours
death is in my sight today
this god is here with us whereas he should go back to egypt
to give praise according to my appointment
concerning their opposing a briber
and the fields were flooded three palms high with the liquid
to expel the influence of a god
as a kings wife does for one she loves
the hnwtjw people are dancing in homage to his majesty
and his place was made spacious
as the kings children stood in the gateway to meet me
his wife says to him
thinking
whom can i talk to today
after he had loaded his donkeys
he is atum at the tying of necks
leader of the door of upper egypt
begotten by amun himself
because of punishing the evil of one who does it
a harp of ebony with gold and silver
from the two lands of fenkhu
incense
as for a judge who ought to be punished
to the place where my majesty is
even a father can have his plenty of grief
it was nice
were shouting praises
loyal to his lord
i do not weep for that mother
their chiefs bowing their heads
their large chariots of gold and silver
the bearded people of the gods land i placated them for your sake
look you are a cook whose joy is to slaughter
who smashes the heads of the evil minded
who creeps in
electrum doesnt match your splendour
33/64 honey
as the destiny that min created for him
more than the smell of fishermen
he doesnt repeat the slaying
overseer of the works
`would that we might see him
i inscribed what i did upon every monument
the people from my district
in my function of initiated
like a god in his hour
my father gave them to me
from the speech of all people
then his majesty said
the princes of all foreign lands are gathered in your grasp
and fled quickly to their town
how beautiful it is when a son receives what his father says
then i brought two warriors as captives from the ship of aata
of bread beer oxen and fowl
then she went
called pen nekhbet
any commoner
revered
chief of the roads
he will not gibber with terror
the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperkare justified

whom i had obtained by prayer
in the evening
ineni justified
to the chief lector priest and book scribe djadjaemankh
inflict punishment on him who ought to be punished
the two lands
my son re god who is greater than he who begot him
the great god who expels disease demons
lord of the thrones of the two lands
like a meeting without a chairman
i conducted the haker ceremony for its lord
who acted justly as you wished

following a statue of 13 cubits of stone
be seated
daily offerings will be made to me
high steward
when your body is buried
his mind was set to it since he was born
the one we follow is in him
the priest says the spell for him
she has no antagonists among the northerners
i have come to you sovereign lord
i am not his companion
an heir who will make offerings
i was one who listened when he heard the truth
junit
but death is reached by knowing it
we were found on the road by a servant of our good lord who had been sent from the palace
gold horus living of birth
and my majesty besieged them for seven months
at the head of his tribe
the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperenre
then this peasant came to plead with him for a second time
if it is his wish to fight
given life
and these messengers were brought immediately
and i slept in a hammock of net
i let priests know their duty
which were destroyed by fire forever
khnum lord of kebehu in abydos
with a target of hammered copper
he captured a herd of twelve wild bulls
easy prey
one to whom the listeners listen
seeing the favour towards you of the king
and had gathered its neighbouring lands
one came to inform his majesty
horus mighty bull appearing in truth
people along with cattle
i did it and you advanced me

he who comes from the darkness
enduring of monuments

as for him who sails with it
leader of priests scribe reneni who lives again

every scribe

he killed 120 elephants in the foreign country of niya
these 100 loaves
to isis nephthys meskhenet heqet and khnum
without putting it
at this block
ready for battle in a narrow defile
that i might answer what he had said

khnumhotep son of khnumhotep son of nehri
min horus chief of the lands

one of a kind
and they put the barley in a sealed room
my name reeks through you
this heaven of yours who is in the palace

an eternal memorial
the bunt will not strip away your sail
and faint from it
who carries out a massacre of everyone
to this god who created her beauty
whats with him there
he created you by the righteousness of his heart
why have you come here
as my majesty wanted to let a pyramid and a temple be built for her
to the might of his majesty from as far as the marshlands
i restored their mortuary chapels
while the king is in the stateroom
a thousand of bread
the begetter who brings the populace into being
when this peasant had said these words
i let a troop of recruits come
oxen
my son re god who is greater than he who begot him
in this flesh of mine
from doing what is right for the king until the stage of revered status
a pillar has fallen in the water
a refuge to the subjects
and a fish pendant of new turquoise fell into the water
a woman that i know
under whose supervision the two silver houses are
and of the gods and goddesses
there is no grave for him who rebels against his majesty
embellished with ebony
but if it expels itself
i carried off two hands
ineni justified
the poor man who spoke with his true heart was found
and it became like human blood
to complain to
what has my lord said to me
i took the crops away from them
i will not speak
on the sandbanks of the land while there was nothing
it is no small matter that your corpse be buried
thou shalt do nothing concerning it
and felled all their trees and all their fruit trees
to report to the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt cheops justified
i will also give offerings precious goods
a command was issued
and they said to his majesty
leader of the work on this statue
justified
son of re amenophis ruler of thebes
and atum and his great ennead
and he was placed on a couch of brick
tnm plants
and lead an expedition on water and on land
they were given to friends of his
hearing is better than any other thing
the priests who-are-in their times
until it becomes dead matter
to avoid suffering in his matter

to be put in water
the priest says the spell for him
and this peasant said
they stood on their walls giving praise to my majesty
desire to last as is said
junit
after it is baked
he opens up the creation
i did not pilfer from the gods offerings
in the city before the council of the entire land
it is the sleeper who dreams
and this peasant said
consisting in branches of doum palm
favour is the memory of a man
without fear in their hearts
that saves me from death
thus beautiful women came into being in momemphis
his majesty didnt halt
existing
we come to bring it
and furniture without limit of southern acacia
may he live forever
or that makes him a friend
to perpetuate the shrines of the gods
and what one city had taken from another
and all monuments that his majesty built for him
we are happy
i was one who was kind
in which there were precious things
to wade in their blood as far as herakleopolis
the place where he is
and the festivals of the seasons
that he will distance himself from my body
who lives in djed snofru
honour the statue of my majesty
you who should let a man attend his truly good cause
more than sitting on sandbanks of crocodiles
the two serpent goddesses are powerful before him like before horus
his heart has obeyed the wish if only i had
who were brought as prisoners
be careful that you do not run aground while at the tiller
i established you on the horus throne for millions of years
excellent horus in the palace
with limitless people and horses
who guides my majesty on the good road
who shall maintain this border that my majesty established
with 120 sailors of the pick of egypt
his majesty entered upon that road
the pronouncement of the king himself
tatenen has given you his possession
divine state
royal decree to the prince and leader of the southern lands turi
it is good for him after he hears
then this goddess came in the early morning
look you have been summoned to hear this matter
they were more courageous than lions
during the first expedition
with the high steward rensi son of meru
speaking is more difficult than any labour
khons the provider in thebes
the good god
and his troop was annihilated
prince regent count leader of the city
without a moment of interruption
by means of the west winds
at this block
whom can i talk to today
speak when he questions you
and their shrines were made anew
you yourself hordedef my son will bring him to me
makes everyone laugh by his evil wrongdoing
the water of the river is drunk when you wish
lords of goodness
it traverses its garden as it pleases
the crown of upper egypt travels north
ineni justified
all the gods
and hear your petitions
but the high steward rensi son of meru remained silent
to have this sleeping potion poured out
while he rushes between the barbarians as a star that crosses the sky
then i will let four cubits of water appear on the sandbanks of two fish canal
a husband to the widow
there follows peace before his ka
whose arrows cannot miss
without expiration of the coming of the appropriate season
more than the smell of crocodiles
rejoicing over his beautiful monument
i was not weak in the opinion of the king
born of the kings mother imi
in the street
and found that these fields were flooded
lord of the thrones of the two lands
answering him is making him retreat
but i will grieve for her children
reaching as far as the western lands
and you are rich in every respect
a thousand of bread and beer
when it is its pans that weigh things

my plea is long and the division is difficult
high steward kares

decimation of your birds
or does he know what the situation is
fashioning his noble image of real electrum
if he is alive there are his arms
their gifts of gold silver lapis lazuli
the feast of the great year and the feast of the small year
like water that quenches thirst
that is a resting place
my ways are good
and were thrown aside throughout their lands
as khons the provider in thebes had commanded
one will not do a thing in abydos
and the overseer of the works of amun hor
lord of the thrones of the two lands
my majesty did this
of fresh myrrh trees
while he rushes between the barbarians as a star that crosses the sky
when i came to her
the villain is an intimate friend
and excellent scribe from among you
i am a noble to be heard
given life stability and dominion like re forever
and the majesty of this god said

the bones hurt because of the high age
the king of upper and lower egypt nebukaure
i let them know the ritual of every day
when his majesty was in naharina according to his annual custom
and he is remembered on account of the goodness
the cabinet of the palace assembled
and placed his eldest daughter before them praising his majesty
it is not an act of people
and muskmelon as if cultivated
but prepare for me the six heqat of barley
a good son
ity born of satsobek
justified
after the water has taken its toll
1/4 cooked earth almonds
the king departed from this life
near the sea to receive the princes of this foreign land
which was there by the millions
so i will eat your bread
kindness has vanished
the officials who were appointed to eradicate falsehood
you will eat delicacies provided by the king
but it is not gathered in
a troop of warriors of unet arriving in peace
doing it is a matter for goodness
he says
any commoner
but the one mighty of strength overthrew them
i tied up the nubian nomads by tens of thousands and thousands
words said by amun re
the pick of the gods land
doing what their spirits like
without expiration of the coming of the appropriate season
which is in the house of aakheperkare justified
that is in the barn as the remainder of yesterdays barley
beloved son of his father amun re king of the gods

while all foreign lands are under your feet
the eyes are to be rubbed in with it
royal seal keeper
my heart fluttered my arms dropped and trembling befell every limb
now my majesty travelled to the ends of asia
every man has his face downcast concerning his brothers
horus who repeats birth

horus beloved of re
once it happens that you have left this place
made to restrain the bedouin
a royal offering of osiris
a block of 4 cubits by 8 cubits by 2 cubits
his house which is in the city along with his estate in the country
it is a vile twist to shoot the enemy
may isdes defend me in the sacred hall
they stood on their walls giving praise to my majesty
the high steward rensi son of meru said
to fetch for him precious goods from every foreign land
the only one of his kind
he is one who creates in his being

all foreign lands were united standing prepared to fight as one
and fowl
and the high steward rensi son of meru sent two guards to fetch nemtinakht
and sunlight as well
he makes the seasons with the months
then these gods were brought
he has filled the two lands with the trees of life
from beautiful white limestone
things are robbed by a criminal
and to the inheritance of the father of my mother
after he had overthrown the chief of the nubians
above the countries of the gods land
spell against pain
considerateness extends friendship
for the nubian listens to the word of mouth
there can be no wavering for any of his plans
the villain is an intimate friend
he then awoke in fear

the great god who expels disease demons
and fled quickly to their town
a very strongly approving nod

in speaking do not take sides
and the fear of you wouldnt permit me to appeal to you
give breath to him who is suffocating
when they saw the beauty of the neshmet barque

who reaches the ends of the earth every day
cows and labourers of offering of amun
life is yours
and the fear of you wouldnt permit appealing to you
in his excellent house of eternity
who established his two lands
then i went
i have said this without boasting and without lie
all protection for life with him
so that mankind doesnt see and lose heart
nacklaces of real lapis lazuli
lord of silence may you give me back my things
placing a boundary marker at his upper egyptian boundary
that your father has built during his victories
the man who sleeps till dawn is the lord of a multitude
do not pour out your heart at the man facing you
heir who grew up among them
with mucus in his neck
and was very frightened
more than the smell of ducks
thinking
now afterwards
to the great barque with five boats a chariot and many horses on the right and left
he established his border to the crest of the world
overseer of the two gold houses
you will not taste the evil of the river
he divided the great river along its middle
so that he makes the odour of the temple sweet
i raised the orphan without a father
anyone fully fluent in speaking
the respect of thoth is in his presence
give praise to my image
oxen dragging you
and may the lord of the stars protect you
with mut hathor
like a meeting without a chairman
craftsmen in creating what is
my heart became tormented
and fetter the bedouin as captives
who made the plan for the masses
dont be outrageous it is not for you
he is possessor of wisdom
and he has come to plead with me about it
speak justice and do justice
burning incense for his father khons in thebes
do not react against him by destroying him
may he hear the prayer from afar
herald kares
in teaching the ignorant to be wise
because i was so excellent in his opinion
the great god who expels disease demons
the recruits who have been trained by their lord
destroyer of falsehood creator of truth
the influence of a feminine pain demon
now these elephant tusks
to rule his city
because he loved justice so much
my name reeks through you
i returned southward my heart being glad
i will not let you kiss him
they come to her with fearful heart
sailing on the sea
whom can i talk to today
the palace is secure and well
and these gods came at his two sides kneeling to the ground
year 2 under the majesty of
a royal commission executed by
in which this god flourishes
then djadjaemankh said to him
landing in karnak
who smites the nomads of nubia
elephant tusks
"khons fourth month """" day 9 """""
when seen
and one turns to strangers
knowing the exact moment of this day
with ointment of white fronted goose
my anguish leads to separation
they would be too numerous to put into writing
under the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt menkheperre
she advanced me
you will not fear
for 4 days
like fire that cooks what is raw
who is a poor man and not your equal
so that i shall live on it
he loved the dog more than his daughter
born of a counts daughter
may you perish
followed by the princes of this foreign land
that they may rush like a bodys shadow
but discuss with the ignorant as with the wise
and i set fire to them
i let them be guarded and protected for my forefathers
your splendour is like the splendour of heaven
words by amun lord of the thrones of the two lands
following his word
in two months
the crew of re is driving in their mooring post
for you block our path with your clothes
who is remembered for his successful deeds
the shares of horus and seth are under his supervision
he who should reproach another is an evildoer
he built this as his monument
his southern boundary reaches to the beginning of this land
i was given male and female servants
fragrance from the palace
with which every god is pleased
and i bound them for you
if one were to recount a deed by its name
be seated
ahmose may she live
and the double crown was raised
i spent 110 years of life which the king gave to me
the man speaks to ra
look the child is in the house with the woman
a man from the delta in taseti
and his majesty said
a man speaks to another
leader free of greed
i have fetched your heads
and i was assigned high fields and low fields
at night i strung my bow shot my arrows
words to be spoken
she might go with me
plated with gold
what do you achieve
doubled trebled and quadrupled
patient
the one in gods booth
the right conduct of life
fix the produce levy according to the grain harvest
such is death
he again did for me a very brave act
i am a possessor of beauty
are you not a man
all his wisdom will last forever
and he saluted me but i feared him
then this god nodded approvingly to his prophet saying
that comes from her offering table at every seasonal festival of heaven
for three children have been born to you
for the place from which he had brought him away
possessor of wisdom
gold horus perfect of years who enlivens the hearts
the tongue of people is their stand balance
but it is a sweet breath from your entrails
there is a messenger of the prince of bakhtan
whose rich ones have one richer
which was called the thrones of the two lands among the people
noise in the southern sky
entry of the foreign lands
he cannot fear him to whom it is submitted
with excellent plans
noisy
death is in my sight today
i captured their inhabitants for egypt
horus enduring of love
to the place where i came into being
who should enrage a man by his ill deed
while his forefathers are celebrating
horus divine of being
osiris nurse of the gods wife rai
i touched the ground with my forehead between the sphinxes
nebtawire
royal seal keeper
the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperkare
yesterday is not remembered
who sees to eternity
menkheperre may he live eternally is the one who opens the way as something perfect
5 pomegranate trees
and found that these fields were flooded
now ubainer was to remain
his true eldest son
the bunt will not strip away your sail
my eldest son nekhet born of kheti was appointed
etc
i have grown old and reached old age
and his northern to input
gold horus sacred of appearance mighty of strength
then the wife of ubainer sent a message to the caretaker
then this army of his majesty arrived in vile kush
for you have subjugated what the sun revolves around
then his majesty ordered to attack these wild bulls
the road that is walked upon
a good crossing or not
another remedy for curing
the fisherman ravages the river
it is to be dried
and i brought booty from there
because of the difficult stone on the ground
and live on their gifts
and praised by month lord of thebes
on the same day
his name has reached the circumference of heaven
an offering the king makes
but then they said to him
so that you may enjoy them
a pellet of incense is to be put in it unbroken
then he came at me while i waited
if he wanders and breaks your advice
your fame has pervaded the crest of the world
see the boat is in the water as the sun shines forth in the horizon
given life forever until eternity
who perform rituals there
but an evil act of someone without need
creates a quarreler out of a cool temperament
how happy is the gods land which you have entered like re
his heart is afflicted his body unkempt
the officials and the soldiers of the whole expedition in its entirety and the children of kep were instructed
son of re of his body his beloved lord of every foreign land
the numerous army of metjen was overthrown within an hour
the majesty of the palace l.p.h. beseeched the stairs of the lord of the gods
unripe sycamore figs were there as well as ripe ones
he gave them to friends of his
then the majesty of nun said
tjenenut
year 1 fourth month of the season of inundation day 19
then the high steward rensi son of meru delivered them
and a wave with it of 8 cubits
the house of the scribe
2 ben oil trees
sweet with regard to love
since his face is blind to what he sees
revere the bee adore his white crown
i conducted the procession of upwawet
a bowl of silver
and all people of abydos
and wearing of fillets
i brought him a sarcophagus
it arose that one of these donkeys filled his mouth with a wisp of barley
who establishes offices like the beautiful of face
to destroy the nubian nomads
who conferred on me all foreigners
smelling the sweet breath of the north wind
during this that khons the provider in thebes and the spirit did
i will go and plead concerning you with anubis
and is straying from what it is reminded of
o living who are on earth
through his excellent plans
royal seal keeper
who overthrew kush
he should stand on yonder side
330 princes each one thereof with his army
it is a levy of all evils
beetle who raised himself
i speak so that you will hear
to widen the borders of egypt
the gods wife bestowed on me another favour the great kings wife
see a good son by the gift of the god
he who should govern according to the laws is ordering theft
every land rejoices at his rising every day
the one who waters mischief to make deception grow
he is atum at the tying of necks
like a mans grasping thereby
you are hapi who makes the meadows green
and furniture without limit of southern acacia
he cannot fear him to whom it is submitted
and the ruler of eternity
the sight was exceedingly beautiful
given life like re forever
with strength and might that i created for you
who know the instructions
etc
then prince hordedef held out his arms to him
that my mother proceeded to become regentess and countess
son of re his beloved tuthmosis ruler of truth
what do you achieve
as you pass on your offices to your children
1/4 cooked earth almonds
praise him like iah
i erected it with columns anew
the eyes are to be rubbed in with it
my name reeks through you
i was a friend of the common people
for his temples of millions of years
with strength and might that i created for you
who made the sacrifice to his son
for i entrusted the earth to you in its length and its breadth
that man is getting away from this city
from the king
i levied their troops of young men
while a servant at his head was anointing him
given vent to what was on my mind
my name reeks through you
with a golden rim
then djedi said his magic spell
but the one mighty of strength overthrew them
this one who is named son of the north wind
salt
you are just like the balance
only pupil of my palace
and the land is left to evildoers
i was happy
in the barque appearing in truth
when his majesty was rowed on it in the barque aton gleams
son of re of his body
the learned man then arrived in bakhtan
and fat of a cow
amenophis
month lord of thebes
and finally he rewarded the chief lector priest djadjaemankh
is without end
his attack having succeeded with valour and strength
makes everyone laugh by his evil wrongdoing
without him suffering therein
saying
so that he may be given life
he is not my son
count
while he let egypt be in its state
and the northerners by hundreds of thousands of captives
o may you go
sole companion
the influence of a god
foremost in the land of the horizon dwellers
he is the sun by whose rays people see
perhaps one may have a servant of your choice come to me
if something is not against her it is not against you
now afterwards
and male and female musicians
the boat is on the nile
for the spirit of the owner of this tomb
his faults are passed over
your good name is that you do not speak
he saw this god come out of his chapel
when he emerged from him out of his body
he outdid what had been done since the time of the ancestors
large quantities of resin of myrrh
his intimate friend
wereret mistress of punt
perfecting everything that my lord had ordered
dont be afraid peasant
before they had lived
upon reporting the collection
suti
to the great barque with five boats a chariot and many horses on the right and left
you were built for festivity
and retreat is cowardice
starting a good journey
then i brought booty from there
do not go mad on making the approach
khons hat netjer neb
rescue me in the domain that is within your reach
etc
your ship will not lag
cheating diminishes justice so render good account
pigeons
of a single year
in the temple
and now they brought them as gifts to my majesty
he makes bodies weak
i have brought djedi
their gods will not receive their white bread
who keeps his name alive
you cannot come up
eldest son of the king of his body
strong men together with invalids
i said to him that he should fight with me
who sees to his city for eternity
whose excellence was made by min
and the northerners in accordance with his guidance
who drives his flock
for i knew that you are content with justice
nor do you give me a reward for this good speech
the princes of retjenu dragged these flag poles
from khons in thebes neferhotep
like a praise singer does
who follows his lady in her strides
his majesty commanded the erection of this stela
with me and the prince of bakhtan
before his majesty and said
for his father osiris
to cover their tombs in the necropolis
his wife says to him
and i overthrew all his enemies
real galena
i sanctified their chapels for the future

with tributes on their backs
you will not taste the evil of the river
two ladies lord of the two lands
i shall return to the primordial water
there can be no heir for the mean spirited
and one might know the excellence of his majesty
his eyes probe every body
with whose plans the lord of the two lands is satisfied
their gates being closed because of it
and they accomplish nothing when your majesty goes down
any scribe
as i cause you to know the manner of eternity
when he rises as harakhti
with noble name in all foreign lands
strong armed men said
i captured for him in the land of naharina
without crowds behind him
i met a man standing on the road
and re said
1/8 wheat
that he may be given very much life
i will let this god stay here in bakhtan
you will prepare laxatives for him
all health and all valour and strength
so that he will feel well immediately
overseer of the granaries of amun
for honesty
then sharahen was besieged for three years
in the midst of those of the kings children
and drink your beer forever
like a gang without a leader
is thoth lenient
as a favour of the sovereign
and it has no way out from him
my heart is glad
the man is in the boat while ra shines on the horizon
their utterances concerned the praises and favours towards me
if you are to be among leaders
the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperkare
whom can i talk to today
amun re lord of the thrones of the two lands lord of heaven
the majesty of re said
children of officials from their towns
and of thoth lord of the sacred word
but it was not in the heart against you
our land we have reached it
high steward
charged with tributes of millions of many things
if you see a man
why is it that you have come here
to gladden the heart of this humble servant
his purification was done
in adorning the god
i made a door of seven cubits of cedar from negau
and all their weapons
i taught every craft that had been forgotten
like a path washed by rain
but the one mighty of strength overthrew them
he created it as his monument for his father amun
ahmose called pen nekhbet justified
to the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt
i lifted my heart and my body
when his father found him
that is what is overlooked in the sight of the greedy
and said to the prophet of khons the provider in thebes
before it has come
the stomach of the loved will be content
do not scorn the childless man
i returned the sand to those who are upon it
in a brief day
he appointed his eldest son nekht
by the chamberlain intef
his majesty established the southern border at heh
his only leader the king of upper and lower egypt menkheperre
by not clashing with him in his moment
that i may live by his mercy
horus mighty bull appearing in truth
put him on land for him to oppose himself
there is no limit to what became mine in victory
it is not a burden on your shoulders

the influence of a dead man
it happened when i wasnt there
horus mighty bull appearing in thebes
turquoise and all precious minerals
said by
keeper of the diadem
son of re his beloved tuthmosis ruler of truth
seeing the monuments of their lords
whereas brutality is for the criminal
leucoma in the eyes
never descended something like it from this land
and i set fire to them
they are his river field when it floods more important than his riches
breath of the mouth is beneficial to the blessed
give us our beautiful gift
correct like a balance
and you will be free of disloyalty
with ointment of white fronted goose
his daughter satsobek
this house
from a net of cord
creator of all
the norm of the divine word
and much gold from wawat
a district overseer who should restrain robbery
you cannot come up
like sitting under a sail
and die in your city
reticent
in order to be glorious and mighty
our lord sent his servant to another city on account of this construction project
faces are blank
and mankind and gods were still united
this wonder that happened to his majesty
may you perish
he surpassed what had been done before
the son of ra
whoever says i snare for myself
it is the lone man that the god fosters
my name will endure because of my character
everywhere
we live as men who have by their labour
her eye is her storm when it sees
his city loves him more than itself
filled with water to its edge
before khons the provider
to what will happen
1/8 leaf of reed
and none looked back
and there is no word of exaggeration therein
as done for a god who loves mankind
now as for the water it was twelve cubits in its middle
the king of egypt
my foremost nobility was
beloved of harmachis
alabaster
let me be brought twenty women who have beautiful bodies
the lord of the two land nebmaatre
the arbitrator is a cheat
foremost of those in the west
and his majesty said what is this hordedef my son
let us see her
do not be greedy against your kin
if he doesnt pass it as worms
cleanse in his life
it was of 30 cubits
the beauty of which i love to see
a royal offering of horus of edfu
i returned following him
his daughter satsobek
and they thrashed all his limbs therewith
let not men see
royal seal keeper
one spoke to the other
whereas my soul has not quarrelled with me before
old man
sculpters drawers metalworkers
fine houses
and they went and spent a happy day with the commoner
make your libation vessels abundant
now this peasant said these words
four times
to make his garden grow with falsehood
and so he went
it struck them opposite to him
a man who worries all day long
none of them offered resistance
then it is not crooked
so that i need not scream
may re hear my utterance
words to be spoken
and said to the prophet of khons the provider in thebes
and their arms grew strong
he divided the great river along its middle
i have been rewarded with gold seven times
upon his return from overthrowing vile kush
every criminal will say
deprived of the profit of speech
and every man is stealing things from his fellow
let an offering be made of a thousand loaves of bread
the one who did justice
i endowed him with fields and servants
amun re lord of the thrones of the two lands
burnt when i wasnt among them
father of the two lands
may he live forever
founded on me
the king of upper and lower egypt maatkare who creates beautiful monuments for me
to his tomb south of peqer
we come and let his children after him prosper
together with the expedition who was accompanying him
but the same could happen to him
acclaimed for his rising and setting
i didnt give of it to the asiatics
stout hearted sharp of horns invincible
with effective counsel
mysteries
in joy
overseer of works in the temple of amun peniati justified
and the goose stood up waddling
do as your master has said for you
recounts what is desired
it gives no results in anything
the sounding rod is in your hand
who is great of strength in battle
alabaster
who overthrows the rebels among the bedouin
so as to set your heart at rest about what you came for
hearts leap up for him
when you go down in the western mountain
if you plough for plants on the margins
catches fish and snares birds
as for the mortuary priest or any person
thereafter one proceeded to retjenu
and every office of the palace were united behind me
and inflicts punishment on him who ought to be punished
drinking water from the watering place of the river
by the envoy of the king
when he spent a moment of recreation
son of re sesostris
on the myrrh terraces of punt
bull stout hearted as he enters the arena
on the fire
when you knew the approach to the water of its chest
do not rejoice in what has not yet happened
the king of upper and lower egypt lord of the two lands
whats with him there
the man listens to another plan in the city
mankind then conspired against him
the plan is good
mistress of all the gods
and the next morning i reached peten
a troop of warriors of unet arriving in peace
with awareness of what happened to you before
he knows the number of chambers of the sanctuary of thoth
330 princes each one thereof with his army
one who is truly close
may your majesty do as he wishes
but who is there stands in a barque
for this statue of the count
while they see their lord
he is one who makes those born with him plentiful
leading me to the road of horus
if you are a leader
i have overpowered mankind
heir of horus in his two lands
so that they may be given the breath of life
lord of fear in the water unapproachable
it is heartache
for honesty
who brought it on the course of restoration
or any poor man
more honoured than those in the primordial waters
in the tree garden around my temple
so they are good too for burial
and placed the gifts that the prince of bakhtan had given him of every good thing
he is far striding when he shoots the fugitive
you will sail on it with a fair wind
and see what is done there
while the face of the helmsman is forward
i transform
whom he hates will bear distress
is without end
a chariot wrought in gold
reached as far as the eastern land
for nine days
while restoring the northern like heaven
bronze
but why do you not hear
and trample the bedouin
who saw the face of khenty
my majesty made you a companion
but to his majesty himself it was revealed
inspiring fear greatly respected
and djedi said
good god
the king of upper and lower egypt djeserkare justified
amun re lord of the thrones of the two lands
it has been prepared with every good thing
the gods and goddesses who are in this land
because it ate my barley
he let me smite all foreigners
after his majesty had slain the bedouin tribes of asia
and you will join the companions
and will tear down mendes
that was very narrow
after she returned drunk without having perceived mankind
and he was the son of a man called isry
the west gives me pleasure
and the rthw qabt people
who chased and captured in every foreign land
i was one who was exact in the palace
lord of the thrones of the two lands
you saw
if he doesnt pass it as worms
is to strengthen the heart of the enemy
with lapis lazuli and turquoise
disclosing to them the unexplored roads
his words are heard
i captured for him in kush
who passes eternity
i saw the digging of the rock tomb of his majesty in private
the younger princess ahmose may she live
overseer of the granaries of amun
re has put the fear of you throughout the land
you show no mercy you are not troubled
the one whom god hates does not hear
left on a hill
carry it to the place of which she had said i will slay mankind there
they gave him the shores and the lands in a single moment
my name reeks through you
about this state in which i was
my neglectful brother
great one free of arrogance
in joy
herald
i did not intend to come to this residence
or will the lazy petitioner be waiting at the door of his house
do not order people except by the guidelines
the king of upper and lower egypt kheperkare
whom he raised over the two banks
to bring exotic goods from the gods land
now
when you appeared
a servant of his choice go to him
a servant of the royal harem
it is the good god
as for him who sails with falsehood for a cargo he does not reach land
they came to call me
all things were entrusted to me under the king of upper and lower egypt
this ruler amunenshi
djehuti hotep revered
i am free of fate
look you are with me as a servant
the keeper of the diadem
ahhotep
in joy
if you go down to the lake of truth
one constructs there for the palace l.p.h.
it is his serpent diadem that overthrows them for him
1/8 wheat
and the entire land while they are prostrate
the might of his majesty guided them
i have given you all life and dominion
about whom is said he belongs to his rival
who reports affairs inside the palace
son of re tuthmosis
for my need is heavy
the inhabitants of the aegean sea and the rebellious lands
his flame that drives away his enemies
to the spirit of the priest of horus of edfu
after i had made his weapons miss
then he put me in his mouth
he placed himself on his belly saying
spread awe of him every day
while you shine before them in my likeness
breath of the mouth is beneficial to the blessed
in a jar
then he thanked the god for me
when i was in the primordial water
and the myrrh terraces unknown to egyptians
ra is with this man
i said this to you
among those who did good
a star fell falling to their south
then his majesty proceeed upon his chariot of electrum
i was stretched out on my belly
an intimate friend is lacking
then this peasant said you beat me you rob my goods
they made me second priest of shau of the altar
after his majesty proceeded to overthrow upper retjenu
i am sweet of love in the opinion of his lord who is generous to all of the people of his town
as he who diminished them
who took possession of the two lands
is this not the proverb that people say
i made for him a palanquin
pulled by oxen
because the great god has ordained
kheperkare justified
who cannot be turned away
welcome in peace
son of re tao
and trample those in the districts of the gods land
all people
it struck them opposite to him
on his ... th victorious campaign
which his majesty made for himself on the west side of the city
1/4 seed of juniper
his eyes
i will not be turned back by the door keepers of the gates of the west
on which a god lives
and the son of their lord
my name reeks through you
its signs of electrum
with my body at home
the portions of the two lords are under his supervision
nor did he answer this peasant
then the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt re came
he erected the upper egyptian boundary marker for me
he whose rank his lord advanced
one who wrongs his confidant for his client
it will mean he is called a fool
my lord
so the son of meru must go astray
at the approach of whose statues the people and the gods were rejoicing
i kept my whole town alive
seizing the one who speeds upon his body
to manage it for her majesty
and the hearts praise in the bodies
a lion is not sent on a mission
if you are a man at a sitting
who shall not fight for it
and the prince of bakhtan came with his army and his officials
the prince regent and count khnumhotep son of nehri
so that my name might be excellent upon every monument that i built
another remedy
may you live like re
for the revered
he reached me as i was standing on the road
that he might answer what i had said
i was one who exact in the house of his lord
than what the entire army achieved
because of appealing to re
of the rule of the father of my mother
with the favour of the king lasting and enduring
then his majesty said
gutted fish and plucked fowl
i am a blessed to whom one should listen
all the gods of upper and lower egypt
the man listens to another plan in the city
he who is nothing
thus sachmet came into being concoction of the night
who will respect its statues
their large chariots of gold and silver
all the gods of upper and lower egypt
ptahwer justified
while he has pain
and who were placed under the feet of the good god
may you let the oath be established
it is more useful for him who does it than him for whom it is done
i created it for myself to gladden my heart
as a mission of the king
every year i sailed north with its tributes to the king
then he made a great offering
he placed the fear of me among all foreigners
but do not respond as one who questions a humble man
the revered the gods father ity says
to heat them
you satisfy my heart at every moment
after i had followed the god to his house
there is no commoner for whom the like has been done
and this haematite was brought to him
to fetch provisions there for my children
may your majesty command to spend a day of celebration
approach of the princes of punt bowing their heads
there was an old man
so as to cause the followers to pray for the proficiency of his arms
then i died for them
who is praised by his lord is not insolent
he divided the great river along its middle
whoever is known as a quarreller
my majesty turned them into ruins
his corpse is cast in the water
savior of the poor
an old document
there were two observers
who guides my majesty on the good road
so that they could not be reconstructed
my soul goes out
none downcast whom you enlivened
if you do this
lord of the necropolis
my name reeks through you
who lived since the primeval time of the land
my lord may you condone that a man calls upon you
who conferred on me all foreigners
behold i am before thee
she gave me all her property in edfu
and had brought osiris
he is the one who brightens the two lands more than the sun disk
and let him speak to me
shall i now be robbed in his district
the majesty of the palace l.p.h. beseeched the stairs of the lord of the gods
which my noble father amun lord of the thrones of the two lands has given to me
on me
i am his favorite servant
a fraction of the object of greed
the influence of a goddess
and was appointed to be chief of upper egypt
my heart lives for your sake
and build his monuments
the southern land to the palace l.p.h.
on the hills of the gods land
djedi then said
etc
it is his power that fights for him
whereas my soul has not quarrelled with me before
and his scalp of real lapis lazuli
dont be haughty in proportion to your might
hundreds of thousands of the finest of all foreign lands
son of re of his body tuthmosis
as master as brother or as friend
then the haematite was put into this beer mash
they said
i will not speak
count
his southern boundary reaches to the crest of the world
splendid place since the time of osiris
hedge plants
nephthys behind her and heqet was hastening the birth
and his majesty saw my valour
is because his house is empty
in his heart i was beneficial
when this foreign land was divided into five parts
his house was his fathers house when he was still a child
i will go to heaven
if you are weak follow a man of excellence
100 loaves of bjt bread
he is praised for his sheltering
for four days
of khons the provider in thebes

when you cross the sky
who was eloquent in anxious situations
a son that listens
the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperenre gave me
yes i know how to sovereign l.p.h. my lord
reached out his hand
to inspire my majestys trust
every land rejoices at his rising every day
every treasure of the treasury
gold horus perfect of years who enlivens the hearts
and swallowed for four days
i captured all their people
my majesty subjugated every land
who brought you who brought you young man
that is in the barn as the remainder of yesterdays barley
it are the fishermen of elephantine who will dig out this canal every year
and djedi was ushered in to him
said by
i reached the walls of my father
he will stay close to me on the day of suffering
pain leaves a swelling pain leaves a swelling
and he married me to his eldest daughter
the child obeys the woman
and the great kings wife tiy may she live
pass over him do not recall it
and there was fighting on the water in padjedku of avaris
how large is this house of yours
from real cedar from lebanon
acolytes
officials are doing evil
then i stretched my legs
and his majesty captured it
o living who are on earth
and said high steward my lord
and all his people as booty
then the high steward rensi son of meru accused
as he governs his two lands
two ladies shining as a flame great of strength
so as to set your heart at rest about what you came for
and from a new papyrus roll he had every petition read out
to be made to dough
without crowds behind him
her head is covered with the kingship of the land
and every kind of precious stone
then he took counsel with his heart saying
i commanded you to make them
with amun is my steering oar
for the first doorway of the tomb
begotten by kamutef
its children are cheering
who will pass this tomb chapel
that this good god performed
and deaf to what he hears
i shall recount what has happened to me
then he made a great offering
2 myrtles
with his conduct im satisfied
nebtawire
on the day of the wag feast
on a windy day
and the misery from them has been pacified
and he was brought to him immediately
for inspection by the lord of the gods
more than any king who lived since the primeval time of the land
i was happy
gold horus sacred of appearance mighty of strength
all wood is splintered like a papyrus reed
good boats
and he reported to him what he ordered to be done
his majesty then reported to khons in thebes neferhotep saying
breath of the mouth is beneficial to the blessed
on the day of the wag feast
let us not go upon that difficult road
for
in the morning
the princes of every foreign land came bowing in peace
for we have seen his might
120 doum palms
the eldest of the three children who are in the womb of ruddjedet
then the wife of ubainer sent a message to the caretaker
and dont listen to anyone who is against him
its stronghold in the swamp land
i shot him
because he made the victories of my majesty greater
then re said
appearing as atum himself
as it is painful for him
who creeps in
he who should rest is making people pant
dont be negligent act at the accusation
one who comes at the voice of the caller
there were two observers
as does a king who is on the great throne
and he went on to say to his majesty
this decree reached me
i captured all their people
if what he has seen come out through him
how lamentable is the poor man you ruin
it was finer than anything
justified and revered
and they came in peace to karnak
1/8 wheat
as he has brought himself
and wearing of fillets
meat offering of every bull
it will completely turn into worms
seeing the favour towards you of the king
wealthy and great in every respect
foremost in the land of the horizon dwellers
look he is eating it
officials he sets the case on that side
this is one who goes forth
should be shelters from the agressor
heir who prospers by the favour of the sovereign our lord
for the word has taught since the time of ra
when this peasant had said these words
the goodness of a good man is good to him
thou wilt not find anything whereon thou mayst rest
my name reeks through you
in fat of pintail duck
my name reeks through you
who placed every land under her feet
i did justice sharper than a needle
i perpetuated what had fallen into ruin
inclined to examine matters
on the day of robbery from the evil terror of the palace
the temples are celebrating
and the arms of my majesty are raised warding off evil
praising the god four times
lord of the thrones of the two lands
a free for all
a haul of catfish
seeking every excellent deed
put whining on a peg
and said high steward my lord greatest of the great
i did what men love and what the gods praise or i did what is loved of men and what is praised of the gods
so that you wont go astray
and of the gods and goddesses
vice chairman of the cabinet
the disease of the man is to be spat on
my son my avenger menkheperre may he live forever
year 22 second month of the season of growing day 10
like a gang without a leader
the foods of his companions
whom he raised over his nobles
and one turns to a stranger
she did everything that a queen should do
his majesty put a great seal on me of pure amethyst
the opponent is born out of impoverishment
on a fishing day
the influence of a god
fare well fare well young man
his name is not effaced on earth
given vent to what was on my mind
in the morning
a burial at the west
then his majesty took counsel with his heart
and gladdened the heart of this humble servant
behold i will take away thy ass peasant
count
and as your children thrive for you
and gathers them
it comes from my body because of the condition thereof
you will let the provisions be given to him
the sight was exceedingly beautiful
more than the smell of crocodiles
another remedy for curing
he should stand on yonder side
while maidservants grind barley for beer
magnifying his victories to let his valour be related
free from lies
son of re amenophis may he live forever
and he was placed on a couch of brick
so you say
he adorned it for eternity
in valour and strength
on that day of great combat
to the palace
the overseer of works suti
i say something great
then they entered towards ruddjedet
son of re tao
made from a single copper plate
for another term on earth
before khons the provider
so you say
all their horses that were with them
you have erected my sanctuary as a work of eternity
and he went down to the pool
sovereign l.p.h.
look i am under way without a ship
how firm you are in your eternal place
words to be spoken
i was a dutiful administrator of your monuments
i saw erection of the great gate
and this peasant was afraid
but it is not gathered in
which was there by the millions
sent a message to the residence to let them know
he sees wisdom as ignorance
who will disturb this tomb
of the lord of eternity
i am one who was good
on this stela of mine
then the choice joints shall be removed from the altars of the gods
to whom people have told their matters
ruddjedet was suffering
with splendid speech before his lady
and another will come
junit
i halted at the road of horus
everybody is filled with his love
when the one who should bring about the deed is unwilling
and everything good from the southern land
at every embankment
i saved my city
no friend for him who is deaf to truth
look you are a man who learned something beneficial
i am a well born man strong and wise
according to whose will he founded the land
or in these members of mine
who has come with many gifts for the queen
as follower of the king in his strides at every place
and you will be everlasting as star in the sky
and the brother with whom one dealt
and unseen by the bearers of the two ladies
that wretched nubian nomad hung with his head downward
and they were put on carts
a refuge to the subjects
there were no deserters
to bring me a precious block
then this peasant left for egypt
skins of golden jackals
and his friends gave them to him
the thrones of the two lands
his head averted
to be unpacked in the festivity hall
the high steward rensi son of meru
and to let them see your majesty as a crocodile
which it had hidden from other kings
every man teaches by his deeds
sole companion
and they pleased his heart
an oracle from the god himself
he says it for him
the sun shines in the daytime
amenmose may he live forever
and there is no impatient man whom one turns to
then he took counsel with his heart saying
but he fled from his majesty to another land
and they fled far away from me
and fashioned the cabin
this peasant said to this wife of his
who knows the morning before it has come
and he was the son of a man called isry
when he shoots at a copper target
his majesty tarried four days
and one did as everything that his majesty had ordered
he loved the dog more than his daughter
i shall make him aware of your greatness
as you pass on your offices to your children
one bracelet
travelling and returning safely
confidant of the king in the southern lands
to be put on the eye lids
in valour and strength
who makes kingship shine
that you are building monuments for osiris
two prisoners
today his heart is glad
i shall do what you wish my way is good
and seeing the beautiful reeds of your lake
i was one who was generous
like re forever
if something is not against her it is not against you
in the fortress slayer of the foreigners
every move according to the measure
as you love life
it puts resentment of it in place of love of it
those who were in egypt heard it
let your eye go that it may smite them for you
dont speak falsehood
in the time of the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt nebkaure justified
born of a counts daughter
do not take up your heart against him
the lady of the land is a mother to everyone
then they sleep as in the state of death
all health all joy
i will also give offerings precious goods
he divided the great river along its middle
and hor
and his majesty ordered him to go to bakhtan with this messenger
nehri son of sobek ankh
his wife pleads with him
and you will make another soul who is hot envious
and it is not difficult for the mouth of him who says this
you will delay him here
my house and everything that is in it
1/8 leaf of reed
six heqat of barley
who destroys evil
or with a message
then they said
who would give water to a goose
that there is no one who could do it but you
an old document
a king who is lauded for his arms in battle
he who hides himself from horus with powerful arm
then the prince of bakhtan let this god proceed to egypt
son of re amenophis ruler of thebes
leader of entire upper egypt
to repel the rebellious lands
after this tomb had been finished
that you recount your expeditions to your wives
to inspire awe by being silent is greater
and gave me
then one woman who was at the stroke oar got entangled in her braids
given life stability and dominion like re forever
his majesty l.p.h. has consecrated male and female slaves
although it is found with slave-girls at the mill-stones
who joines with the body of sekhmet
who can be ferried across
for whom there is no escape from the west
welcome in peace hathor who helped the creator
by the command that issued from the mouth of the majesty of
worship the one who raises the double crown
watching over
then the majesty of nun said
would that a moment would destroy
then his majesty said to one of these companions
then i called to the expedition that was on this boat
overseer of the two silver houses
took his donkeys away and drove them to his district
and i will let his majesty go to bakhtan to save the daughter of the prince of bakhtan
your silence is more benefit than creeping talk
and this peasant came to plead with him for a sixth time
fowl
you will not be put in the wool of a ram
that man is getting away from this city
then my majesty erected my stela on that mountain of naharina
o that thou mayst act according as i say
osiris nurse of the gods wife ahmose nofret iry
royal seal keeper
the influence of a goddess
brothers are evil
more than the smell of crocodiles
a distant place in fear
two ladies beautiful of laws who pacifies the two lands
that excellent god
oil
they are the flock that is good for their lord
as he who diminished them
fine words are more sought after than greenstone
it is to be dried
look they have fled to the desert
so the officials who hear may say
than those of the ancestors built before me
and your provisions in the storehouse
as my mouth opens to speak
he said high steward my lord
what is it that we have come for
death is in my sight today
valiant montu on the battlefield
what i have done on earth is not little
together with everyone in bakhtan
that day
he created it as his monument for his father amun re
the foreigners of retjenu will not rebel again
and discrete about the affairs of the palace l.p.h.
who will protect its inscriptions
death is in my sight today
and he saluted me one who feared him
it was done there in an act of massacre
with his eldest son in command
the pick of the gods land
and his eyes in seeing
then i made my way northward
there is no artist whose talent is fulfilled
but do not respond as one who questions a humble man
it happened to the majesty of my lord
may he be given life like re eternally
then she put it in a box
month lord of thebes
he will lead you through a good lifetime
beloved of his city

being millions of men
lord of burial after old age
i was happy

to the chief lector priest ubainer
all their horses that were with them
that there is no one who could do it but you
according to what i did on earth
a truly good god
and grew rich in cattle
they were under my supervision

he was a peasant of the wadi natrun
the king of upper and lower egypt sehotepibre
year 14 under the majesty of

i was highest administrator of all works
foremost of karnak
to fight and conspire against my majesty
at the coming forth of the hm ntr priest

water issued from the roughness of the stone
and detest death
the bank is steep and the ways are under barley
do not attack one who cannot attack
when the day dawns of his slaughter in the morning
and one turns to a stranger
the commander in charge of the border patrol
that he composed for his children
smelling the sweet breath of the north wind
a matter of live in truth
from the southern provinces of upper egypt
coming in peace saying
this nemtinakht to the officials who were with him

and lead an expedition on water and on land
to the north of mednit
nor is there casting of falsehood on the ground
a mistress of command
so did for him the good god amenophis given life forever
horus living of birth
then the haematite was put into this beer mash
in front of his entire army
the servant loaded it for his lord when he commanded his doing it
and the city was gathered rejoicing
one will find its trustworthiness
for you have been brought up as a pupil of my majesty
two ladies prosperous of years
for his father min lord of the foreign lands
this god is here with us whereas he should go back to egypt

death is in my sight today
after i will have entered the myrrh terraces
with ointment of white fronted goose
it is my place of enjoyment

and my duty of clothing priest
it rejoices over him more than over its god
and this peasant came to plead with him for a ninth time
and i cannot slay them until i have heard what you might say about it
i spent many years

he grabbed common folk
a slight man whom you know
none are righteous

all tributes to the temples were increased
the overseer of the works of amun
the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperenre
170 date palms
and my majesty besieged them for seven months
a method that has been successful
i created it for myself to gladden my heart
the glance of man had not fallen upon it
to receive this expedition of the king
now when some days had passed after this
that one came to say to his majesty
i let egypt be chief
the scribe ineni justified
at last he sits down
son of re tuthmosis

a truly correct man who strays
in the necropolis
the man who made it
beloved and given life like re

and was now returning having carried off captives from libya
all controllers of phyles
brightly plumed
he will not fail to do good to the land which will be loyal to him

since i am deliberating
foremost in the house of his lord
to see the sun
what my soul said to me
he let me choose for myself of his land
it is more than exaggeration
before it has found a way out
every man is robbing his fellow
so i have now plied my sounding rod
fear of whom was throughout the lands
cattle too numerous to count
who went in peace
has become an enemy
it is heartache
i will fetch him
like the smell of myrrh
after i had seen that you had an excellent character
now i know the lord of this district
i had pure arms in decking the god

and my accusation brought departure
may my soul not depart
old age is achieved for him by it
welcome in peace o gracious one
royal seal keeper
bring me personnel of the academy
it befits a son that he be the champion of his father
his mouth says
to cross that great river
bend your back to your superior
if you would call burial to mind
initiated in the temples
without me saying
of baboons vervet monkeys and greyhounds
has anything happened in the residence
his beloved wife iuri
and judges are carrying off what it seizes
my house
and cast aside my misery
has stiff cervical vertebrae
and to honour the god as he desires
then she caused to be brought to him a box filled of garmants
every day because of the greatness of the love of him
i was clothed in fine linen
he attackes every land with his strength
each one of them was more courageous and stronger
leader of the door of upper egypt
it was reported to me
and all good products of this foreign land
in the evening
and the love of me was in the palace l.p.h.
after he has spent many years
command and it will be done
since one cannot know what is going to happen in it
so that they could not be reconstructed
without putting it
do not vent your heart on him by his wretchedness
and did not know myself before him
destruction among your water fowl
priest of horus and pakhet
the king of upper and lower egypt menkheperre given life
the secret of the truth will be found
of tjsps wood and xsyt wood
a ship could not sail on it
and that he might adorn it for eternity in his tomb of the necropolis
the man who made it
before his circumcision
for the scribe ahmose
than those of the ancestors built before me
and justice will be neither insufficient nor excessive
wind storms in addition to rain
the quantity that he captured was greater
in a distant land that people do not know
all foreign lands together carrying their gifts
magistrate and commissioner of the domains
and every heart was sorry for me
one is contented with evil
the younger sister of queen nefrure
look misfortune is on every side

i will fetch him
greatly beloved
when the town of avaris was besieged
and his two plumes danced
to be ruler of input
im telling you what he did
and they went up in flames because of it
refreshing under his sycamores
there came a strong man of retjenu
gold horus living of being
and he arrived in the district of per fefi
we will not again do evil against menkheperre
we are happy
who reflects on the plans of his lady
then your plans will be among the officials
i decked the god with his weapons
then his majesty said
and locked it up
was at the counsel of your heart to you
in the middle of the night
to be put in water
i came to let you crush those on the turtle backs
then who will repel evil
foreseeing what was to come
who brought you to his island in the sea
having gone from qedem to retjenu
it was without equal on earth
when he proceeded to champion his father
this scribes hands are in the water but his feet are on the ground
he is a brave king an excellent fortress to his army
says
founded for all eternity
would that a moment would destroy
the fear of my god was in my mind
i passed east of the quarry above the mistress of the red mountain
the islands in the middle of the ocean
then that enemy called tetian came
the excellent ones and inhabitants of his house

a total of 15 boundary markers
one would snare for me
1/4 end of xayt plant
praised in the palace l.p.h.
as it is good to listen to people
the hearer to whom it is said is effective in the body
on a windy day
a king who is lauded for his arms in battle
and it was pleasure to my heart
great kings wife
this was copied from start to finish
i returned southward my heart being glad
they could foretell a gale before it came
you rewarded me on earth in karnak
this is the road of thoth to the house of maet
i commanded you to make them
a bundle of all hatefulness
the influence of a feminine pain demon
the king of upper and lower egypt kheperkare may he live forever
to be accused of it each day
another remedy
have you come to hurt him
death is in my sight today
without mentioning retjenu
look you have been summoned to hear this matter
if it is a hand balance
or you will go to the abode of the lord of silence
he who should give breath is suffocating on the ground
because their hearts are fearful about what i said to them
ought me
making the lower chapel for myself
heir who grew up among them
it is not an act of people
but not for cheating
strong ruler who has destroyed the nubians
at landing
returning praised
from beautiful white limestone
and the festival hall of every god

the nubian nomads from khent hen nefer
menkheperre
who ordains laws

then his majesty sent a numerous army to taseti
an intimate friend is lacking
as for any man who will put his hand
bring them stealthily
of green gold from amu
i came to let you crush the princes of palestine
then i was appointed to be warrior of the ruler
with his conduct im satisfied

while they bowed their heads to the ground
and what he had ordered to be done was reported
nehri justified and revered
his image will be over you for the life of your house
with fields in front in the right place
royal seal keeper
but as to everyone over whom it is read every day
then the prince of bakhtan went on to report to his majesty saying
whose personality was shaped by the lord of the two lands
his beloved

all health from me and all joy from me
the revered the gods father ity
is this a cause for punishing this nemtinakht

so that i may have him report to you about it
and to let them see your majesty as your two brothers

until reaching the town of itji tawi

and every servant was at his duty
who then will repel evil
and despoiled his encampment
may she fail what she came for
were shouting praises
and an apron to the motherless
at this moment
his beloved who protects the father who begot him
a man with an empty stomach is a man to complain
because he trusted me
because of the greatness of the might of this noble god amun re
you are hapi who makes the meadows green
having taught himself knowledge
the oldest prince came out the supreme commander of this father
on the hills of the gods land
beneficent seed of the god which came from him
distance your sight restrain yourself
but it is the act of a god
there is no eye that is more able than she to smite them for you
of tjsps wood and xsyt wood
so you should take account of me
who was generous to common people
and judges are carrying off what it seizes
a great one who is greedy is not really great
on the sandbanks of nedit
the high steward rensi son of meru
if you acquire then give to your fellow man
are people ushered in to you
now it was the majesty of this august god
a thousand good things
then she said to her maid

the good god sesostris

as does a king who is on the great throne
i have given you all life and dominion from me all stability from me
a slight man whom you know
if you sever who will join
you show no mercy you are not troubled
to the priesthood of the temple of abydos
one who has nothing
he captured a rhinoceros by shooting in the southern land of taseti
though no brother of his can be fetched to side against you
now i was in the van of our army
while he is happy on the horus throne
in order to be given the breath of life
do not scheme for what has not yet come
then one acted according to everything that the majesty of this noble god had commanded
youths from east unet
beloved of month lord of thebes who lives in armant
if you meet an opponent in his moment
i commanded a mortuary offering
he goes outside
lord of abydos
mistress of the two lands

the numerous army of metjen was overthrown within an hour
the king of upper and lower egypt lord of the two lands nebmaatre
their tails behind him
this statue came from the mountain as a block
and what they did was good
which his majesty gave to the temple of amun
withdraw the flood so as to do justice
which were desirable to his heart
then the royal scribe thothemheb came before his majesty
their districts were massacred
but there can be no tomb for one who rebels against his agency
is this a cause for punishing this nemtinakht
hides of panthers
my name reeks through you
i came to let you crush the aegean islanders
one will thank the god for you
this fine boat of mine
that id found obliterated upon the doorways
beloved of the king
like the skys clearing
as should be done
their tails behind him
concerning his rank of leader of the city
which i built for it to be shade for my soul
to herakleopolis in order to plead
stonemasons artisans
subservient to him are the islands of the ocean
and everything that is done for a king in the room
man of justice before the two lands
now i was in the van of our army
free of impatience
i let many ships be constructed of cedar
crossing his western garden
harendotis
he will not be guilty
my heart being my companion
horemmekhib
on the fire
who created himself
and her gaze was pleased by it
to you each day is a moment
a dagger
and found him emerging from the gate of the temple of arsaphes
and this goddess said
the influence of a goddess
the king of upper and lower egypt lord of the two lands

as something to good effect before your workers
as it is painful for him
i captured for him in kush

your avarice will befool you
herald kares
your spirit is with you
plumb line that carries the weight
may he live forever
follow your heart as long as you live
but justice is for eternity
royal seal keeper
on the horus throne of the living
more than the smell of fishermen
memory of him is in the mouth of the people
then this matter was recounted
hounds guenons apes
a royal offering
i was one who was generous to him who depended on me
desire me here
by amun lord of the throne of the two lands
sovereign l.p.h. my lord
it goes down with him who does it to the necropolis
and inflicts punishment on him who ought to be punished
i have given you millions of years
what do you achieve
magistrate who solves problems
watching over
there everyone sees and the multitude is pacified
the hearer becomes one who is heard
the servant of the king will have revered status
but look you are the lake that pulls him under
i crossed a boat having been given to me
in this land in its entirety
of someone whose eyes have the bjdj disease
after him riding on this chariot
my name reeks through you
a well was found in the middle of the valley
how great is the might of amun
and to punish the robber
may they take as much myrrh as they wish
seen by those who tread on it
then his majesty proceeed upon his chariot of electrum
worship the one who raises the double crown
before the council of the entire land
the princes of all foreign lands are gathered in your grasp
like a young panther at a resting herd
not considering the northern lands
royal linen white cloth fine linen moringa oil
reached as far as the western lands
do not defraud a poor man of his property
i let the divine ship sail
how joyful is the land that he rules
since i had taken their horses
ruler of eternity
i kept alive the name of my father upon them
seeing the favour towards you of the king
to take them away is to stop up his nose
for the shrine of the august chamber
and build his monuments
as they came to engage my majesty
lord of the foreign lands
to the north of mednit
strong armed men said
their villages to him kissing the ground
have you come to kiss this child
which had been in the hands of a companion
lapis lazuli
wenen nefer
may thoth declare concerning me the gods are satisfied
who consorted with the ignorant
who will enter this tomb
to be mixed
the goose stood up cackling
you will not be put in the skin of a ram
for the limbs of the god
as to that burial
common soldiers
there is no profit in things if it is stifled
5 ziziphus trees
it being still in its place
leader of the administration of the lord of the two lands
is the stand balance biased
like the smell of lotus flowers
i lifted my heart and collected myself
this temple
of bread beer oxen and fowl
while i do not listen to him
ikhernofret revered
who didnt arrest a man for an utterance
by him in whose body the pains are
a diadem
she is the wife of a priest of re lord of sakhbu
the wind rose and rose again
and the majesty of this god said
may you give me a sweet breeze
in this form
fight on his name
lady in waiting
without my messenger being hindered
that sails north past abu sir forever
she spent the day there while drinking
of gods and people
do not rejoice in what has not yet happened
and he will feel well immediately
who makes them live
whom can i talk to today
i conducted the procession of upwawet
he has made me lord of the five portions
redress is short but evil is long
after it is baked
create shelter so that your shore will be safe
she calmed upper egypt
they are the flock that is good for their lord
avoid the instant of sloth
city of a sovereign that conspires to rebel
and it became like human blood
because he sees me carrying out your affairs
and customs houses were established on the river
and you are still robbing
as monuments of eternal age
to the supports of heaven
their holding true that is their wealth
to the place where my majesty is
then the high steward rensi son of meru gave provisions
his majesty sailed north
his eye had not yet been afflicted
may your majesty proceed and may you see the wonder
he is a king who fights alone
with sailors whom you know
preserve the monuments of my majesty
my serpent diadem on your head consumes them
respect him according to what he has become
myrrh is mine
i shall do what you wish my way is good
coming and going are by his command
before khons in thebes neferhotep
do not hold back from the presents of his giving
she who will make
he comes who is summoned sovereign l.p.h.
than your corpse being buried
as you wish to see me in health
my majesty sent
she who is in his presence
he can draw up a will by it
how bad it will be for every man on that day of fear
who shuns evil
and all your conduct will be good before god
i made your enemies fall under your feet
there was nothing that was not on it
as for the fool unable to hear
in our lifetime
my brother
inscribed with my own name
it is the tethered bull that strikes the dueller
and they say they beseech peace
inflict punishment on him who ought to be punished
then my body will become young again
i begot her for me
then the maid went to get a cup of water for herself
to one with whom he had been angry
then the haematite was put into this beer mash
who gives life
with a ship or any herds of the nubians
before khons in thebes neferhotep
they destroyed what had been built
list of names of the male and female slaves from the booty given to me
dont listen to the heart
remember my titulary
put his fame in others
in the kingship of the land
seated in a palanquin of ebony
to be mixed
standing on their chariots
turquoise and every kind of herb from the gods land were on their backs
and his scalp of real lapis lazuli
perhaps you will let me to see the place where my heart dwells
horus living of birth
as his boundary to unet
all his serfs and cattle
21 hands one horse one chariot
helmsman dont let your ship go off course
given life forever
as he sat on the thrones of geb
you can belittle bad speaking
without him giving anything thereof to his own house
there is no barbarian who associates with a marsh dweller
in accordance with the utterance of the lord of the gods amun
while he let egypt be in its state
he recognized that i was one who did what he praised
look you are a ferryman who ferries across anyone who has the fare
as it is painful for him
when the gods of upper egypt grasped him
is it not wrong
a man runs
pouring water
and my heart was not in my body
accurately spelled
and none will surpass your rectitude
someone who suffers from mucus in his throat
that i might answer what he had said
great kings wife kings mother
a mortuary offering
it belongs to the high steward rensi son of meru
let my name be good in your city
while he has pain in his stomach
coming in peace saying
without him giving anything thereof to his own house
and trampled the towns on its banks
and of the ennead mistresses of thebes
for lack of an intimate friend
i increased awe of you in every body
a man runs because of the lack of someone to send
amun is his protection
and this peasant had him report back
and a successful act took place against them caused by me
sem priest with clean fingers
its one side was under water
cleanse in his life
none ignorant whom you let know
two ladies shining as a flame great of strength
who creates truth and creates all goodness
foreign lands of metjen
by a man who is my peer
giving him his arm
i did to him
in the time of fear of the palace
and this peasant came on the public path
to step into his official boat
khons the provider in thebes arrived safely at his house
he is the great god
that is at the sacred mountain
he is beheld like re when he rises
and he restored what he found ruined
but what is the gain thereof to you
and dismiss the west
it brought me to the ways of flight
and he found ruddjedet sitting in grief
one with powerful arm the like of whom has never been
he had concealed it
like re forever
i placed myself on my belly
this scribes hands are in the water but his feet are on the ground
then i answered this to him
i did justice sharper than a needle
real galena
to inspire my majestys trust
by sailing north or by land
of three digits in thickness
i was one who was calm with the angry
as all subjects of my majesty
they come to him with bowed heads
he goes outside
excellent of judgement
his house was his fathers house when he was still a child
it is the god who makes him excellent
while i join the praised ones
given life stability and dominion like re forever
i came to let you crush the border people
the king of upper and lower egypt djeserkare
to their towns
without millions of men behind him
and those who were aboard did the same
and she became well instantly
the influence of a dead man or dead woman
look mankind which issued from my eye
mankind then conspired against him
the return in safety by the prince
its old are rejuvenated
vessels and jars of silver
in the temples of upper egypt
and he said high steward my lord
and you will make another soul who is hungry envious
a loveable man
making for him a resting place of eternity
vessels of granite
his majesty shot
i will recount to you something similar
his majesty commanded the erection of this stela
i crossed a boat having been given to me
on account of a little natron and a little salt
look mankind which issued from my eye
the feast of the great year and the feast of the small year
he wouldnt come at all
i didnt rob
who perpetuates the names of the ancestors
thus sachmet came into being concoction of the night
overseer of the two gold houses
1/64 flour of dates
have you come to cause silence
may the king of egypt be merciful to me
they gave praise to the lord of the two lands
then a boat will come from home
he ordered it to me against all foreigners
to the place where his majesty was
as you pass on your offices to your children after a good old age
his mucus is in his belly
she recruited its infantry
he is an excellent son
and he restored what he found ruined
their altars were bare
then his majesty said to khons in thebes neferhotep
and erecting the southern gate seka hotep
and i arrived on the island of snofru
if you meet an opponent in his moment
and it is the hand balance that detects deficiency
and to let them see your majesty as possessing the wings of horus
with his heart in accord with mine
and djedi said
i had spent a year and a half there
beloved of satis mistress of elephantine
made for you by your beloved son
what he had planned to do to me
may re hear my utterance
greater was my praise in the palace than that of any unique friend
and i followed the god in his steps
in that land of naharina
and restrains me from death
as a favour of the sovereign
summon a man concerning his just cause
in addition to the catch of my hounds
he who will give
upon his throne
with my arm with my bow
beat him with the hostility of the officials
death is in my sight today
second month of the season of inundation
and what one city had taken from another
as a man respects one whom his land knows
natron
while i was on my belly before him
my house is fine my grounds are extensive
like the skys clearing
and put my backside on his chest
the place where he is
then ruddjedet said
for i have grasped all that his eye revolves around
he placed himself on his belly saying
appearance by the majesty of
as if a marsh dweller saw himself in elephantine
whom the king of lower egypt advanced
the singer neferhotep
a major who accepts bribes
arrogant
when he approached me
if she is wayward
since the god of those who had received the white crown
it is re who commanded it for me
as you will not be turned back at the difficult place
the norm of the divine word
the heart is the creator of its master
considerateness extends friendship
his house which is in the city along with his estate in the country
after it is baked
i captured their inhabitants for egypt
keftiu and isy being in awe of you
if you are to be with people
apart from a nubian who shall come to trade in mirgissa
i was one who was kind in the offices
they no longer had horses
the man is in the house
at the lake of niya
as his majesty took possession of his inheritance
a commoner cultivates his plot
without ever perishing in this land
and his majesty himself said it for love for me
first hm ntr priest
and your share of the cargo will be what you seize
my majesty sent
since the god of those who had received the white crown
before i have come to it
if a ship goes down it is looted
concerning every office that he held
there is no misstatement therein
his beloved
it is rich in all kinds of fine things
of millions and hundreds of thousands of miles
usermare sotpenre
the majesty of re then said
through his excellent plans
as you are in the favour of your ruler
may he live forever
by the grant of the king to me
he chose me from his city
the glance of man had not fallen upon it
in the midst of the pyramids
who does things successfully
male slave paam
for old age has come
my hands have endowed your body with protection and life
and strike the heads of the asiatics of retjenu
then these gods were brought
there can be no sleep for the lone man

which has passed when you go down
noferperet
praised by all her gods
the good god
both upper and lower egypt
that endures forever
then he was brought before his majesty with his gifts
as though they had never been
from the provinces of lower egypt
so may re lord of the two lands be gracious to you
put into effect the rule i have drawn up
oxen
given life forever
there is no exaggeration
royal confidant amenemhet

whose lord has entered his reflections
among the blessed

for a sarcophagus
the evil that scourges the earth
lord of the throne of the two lands at his beautiful feast of luxor
loading of ships to a very large extent

lord of the crown
beer
or the influence of anything bad
i said to him
it is they who find what one lives on
my ways are good
as the sun sets and rises
of the servants of the kings of lower egypt
begotten by him in this place
from the palace three or four times a day
her nose behind her
a thousand loaves of bread
the lady of the heavens sees the horizon every day as she is in her sacred bark
because he loved him so much
and his majesty fell into a bad mood at this
after making it
i am your father
you will accumulate precious things that they will give to you
his son took his place as king of the two lands
the house is in the city
his majesty did all sorts of fine things for me because he had known me as an overseer of construction projects who is better than all the overseers of construction projects in this land
to the place where his majesty was
that his majesty did continuously
my son is a scribe
live in their houses
every land being its subject
relieve the distress
and he went up higher
he is stout hearted when he sees multitudes
purple nutsedge

and the overseer of works hor say
and one who should lead has gone astray
i have ordained it to you long ago

and will not forsake you
ahmose nofret iry may she live
in the city that you have known
such is osiris
and faint from it
this idea carried away your heart
born of dedetnekhbet
with its construction for all eternity
there is no yesterday for the negligent
and what is good as what is painful
who immediately overpowers all foreign lands
who rises in the morning
summon to me swift nimble messengers
and to let them see your majesty as a wild lion
while his appearance was youthful
patricians were in the necropolis
and the helm is in your hand
the good goddess maatkare who lives again
your equal a man from your levels
whom can i talk to today
the king of upper and lower egypt nebpehtire given life
which my noble father amun lord of the thrones of the two lands has given to me
like sitting under a sail
the divine body merging with him who created him
i found figs and grapes there
and for monuments
i was free of pilfering from the property of the god
and it was pleasure to my heart
basket have you not gone too far
he attackes every land with his strength
then avaris was captured
praising the god four times
words to be spoken
he is horus with a powerful arm a excellent fortress to his army
in valour and strength
a block of 4 cubits by 8 cubits by 2 cubits
as i was justified on earth
i traversed land as if it were river
without your taking care
its banks were planted with all kinds of sweet trees
whose rich ones have one richer
and our crew has come back safe
who immediately overpowers all foreign lands
he appointed me to be count in the year 19 in menat khufu
uproar in the northern sky
who created mankind the king of the people
fight against opening up the bonds on you
another is in the house with the woman
`hail to you re
who carries out a massacre of the bedouin tribes of asia
if you see a man
he intended to smite me
he will not evade the matter
he who belongs to montu
consisting of three gallons of barley every day
i opened my mouth to my soul
she is the excellent stern rope of lower egypt
this goddess returned after she had slain mankind in the desert
their arms are raised in adoration
what i shall do for you is good
one who lives on defenceless birds
he is horus with a powerful arm a excellent fortress to his army
open hearted free of darkness
but a good hearing is soothing for the heart
go to elephantine
my majesty sends you to do this
he did not answer these officials
an old document
to travel south therein
while his forefathers are celebrating
he crosses over to this city his daughter with him
who was eloquent in anxious situations
given life forever
so as to set your heart at rest about what you came for
as tax each year
no losses occurred to the evil ones
when his father found him
then he took counsel with his heart saying
more than the smell of ducks
he appointed me as kings son
whose heart led him astray to alien lands
while i lived with the king
then the high steward rensi son of meru sent two guards
i let everyone tarry
as for every lector priest and every scribe
look my soul is disobeying me
foremost of those in the west
i touched the ground with my forehead between the sphinxes
were on every monument that i built
that you should fear your punishment
his favourite place since the beginning
or the influence of anything bad
horus mighty bull appearing in thebes
will lack bread for his statement
as perished as those who have never been
who then will bring it to me
has become an enemy
scribes
and fat of a cow
served by the stars in heaven
for look your harbour is surrounded by crocodiles
and to let them see your majesty as an upper egyptian jackal
into a walled enclosure with a ditch
begotten by it
he governs what the sun revolves around
death is in my sight today
if he is ordered to replace it then he will replace it
primordial one
because the great god has ordained
to be mashed
excellent god
the sun rises for your sake
investigating what was of old
then his majesty said
you have come to us to be merciful to us
giving tax corn for the storehouse of offering of amun
is there no road to his majesty
then he laughed at me
before we had reached land
but look your donkey
two ladies enduring of kingship like re in heaven
and found the fish pendant lying on a shard
and let his sentence be executed
this god arrived in bakhtan at the end of one year and five months
i will not let their men live
jubilation is throughout the entire land
beloved of the king
this is placed before you
because of letting its choice offerings be given
if you see someone suffering from mucus
i did everything that his majesty had ordered
it was provided with fields
more secret than the fashion of the underworld
then the high steward rensi son of meru gave provisions
servant of min in the foundation ceremonies
and eases pain
during this that khons the provider in thebes and the spirit did
he proceeded to the district of peqer
until she arrived at this august mountain
come with them to the palace
may he live forever
about this grievance
the light of the uraeus is your protection
without confusing one with another
in reply to him
who overthrows the rebels among the bedouin
fine words are more sought after than greenstone
noisy
king of the black land ruler of the red land
it is a sacred region of the gods land
the servant loaded it for his lord when he commanded his doing it
on this day one is in the good palace
greeting o blessed one
and i bound them for you
look you are strong and powerful your arm is strenuous
they say
adorned behind me
then i carried off his property
the spoken word is more persistent than weed
like the smell of myrrh
a sure marksman
she gathered its deserters
after confinement
you are trusted
the primeval god who created your beauty
within a house you may enter
follower of the palace
consisting of
may you come to me and rejoice at seeing my beauty
after she returned drunk without having perceived mankind
a mortuary offering
and made two guards turn against him with whips
is it not really him
they all went on donkeys
who eradicates them
none of them offered resistance
my legs have ceased to follow
with my movements
he captured a herd of twelve wild bulls
behold god has caused thee to live
and strewed it over my chest
if something is not for you it is not for her
sole companion
offerings and sustenance
and from the south of wabut
i perpetuated the name of my father
you will not step on my clothes
more than fattened birds
the name of her mother is tjuia
make the case with him alone
every day because of the greatness of the love of him
but i was like a man seized in the dusk
i speak truthfully
the demolition of a wretched heart is a difficult matter
so that i may tell him the words of those who have heard
for inspection by the lord of the gods
and seeing its surrounding fields and its beautiful watersides
he placed me at the head of his tribe
after the water has taken its toll
then it will rot in his belly
and each one was outdoing his fellow
start of work at this mountain
temple of ptah 8 1/2
leader of the city
djehuti hotep revered
the kings children who were following him
and he went on to say to his majesty
to do their duties
justified
treasurer baqet
justified
he knew my eloquence while my appearance was youthful
as the foremost of those in the west praises you
i opened my mouth to my soul
now the house of this nemtinakht was at a waterside path
every day

to enslave to her the bedouin

and clothing
do not put one thing in place of another
the sea people hearing your battle cry
of the king of upper and lower egypt usermare sotpenre
a rod that makes waters accessible that have stayed behind during low tide
he who should see has turned blind
to what the sun revolves around
but the truth returns to correct it
knowing the outcome
as i have seen an example of his learning
showed me the way to the cabinet
with his heart in accord with mine
noses turn cold when he starts to rage
but there is no field for ploughing that creates itself
a great lord takes what is without owner
and he with whom one walked
and to let them see your majesty as shooting star
he is a brave bull
accompanied by my troop of recruits
everyone has a need for you like water
he is a brave king an excellent fortress to his army

precious wood comes for me from kush
amenhotep god and ruler of thebes
that you are on earth
that one of these peasants comes here
how pleasant is your grace to my breast
and this peasant came to plead with him for a sixth time
i will go to petition on account of you to anubis
a troublemaker is a man with no mind
and mankind and gods were still united
or anything good that may be done with them
bringing the best of the offering table
and my misery has ended up before you
tore out their barley
and its excess perishes on the ground
the shoulder is not injured by being exposed
my favours from the king
words to be said with gall of tortoise
and they were put on carts
he seizes like a crocodile in the council
his majesty ordered the rebuilding of this temple again after his finding it in ruins
it comes from my body because of the condition thereof

a king who will perform the kingship in this entire land
horus mighty bull appearing in truth
horus powerful of spirits
leader of the temples of the red crown
son of iah
i came to let you crush the western land

he created it as his monument
existing
foremost of karnak
i seized the southerners under the command of his spirit

an advisor
knowing the exact moment of this day
and his mouth wanders into evil speech
the cultivator of wickedness is watering his garden with evil
o eldest god in whom i came into being
foremost
i am truly despised
then he will pass it
he crossed the river euphrates
fear of me in the ends of asia
and of the regentess greatly praised
my majesty turned them into ruins
3/4 water
the inhabitants of the aegean sea and the rebellious lands
in order to satisfy his spirit
says
oil
with honey
someone who suffers from mucus in his throat
his nose behind him
then he said go and bring me the chief lector priest and book scribe djadjaemankh
offering on the altar
whereas formerly the majesty of this noble god had been on seven carrying poles
their tongues were not partial
djehuti hotep
consisting of every excelling deed of bravery since the beginning
after they had changed their appearance into that of musicians
the lid of this sarcophagus descended
he sat down on the dais of horus
none sleeping whom you roused
i will not let him go back to egypt
and the northerners come bowing to my might
khepri who tires himself with labour
in that land of naharina
calves were slaughtered goats were sacrificed
the judges are a fattened basket
as my mouth opens to speak
i took a fire drill made fire
you are trusted
more than anything in this entire land
placing a boundary marker at his upper egyptian boundary
its old are rejuvenated
he appointed him to be prince regent count
son of re sesostris
that organ in a man is his canker worm
there is nother that is not in it
let me be brought a criminal who is in prison
goodness has been harmed there is no accumulation of it
on summer days
but then they said to him
then i conveyed the king of upper and lower egypt djeserkare justified
of real cedar from lebanon
when he is peaceful people breathe his air
to prevent that any nubian should cross it
consisting of three gallons of barley every day
and every man in your environment is corrupt
that is exactly how that man is too
so that he will be a model for the children of officials
when a painful thing has passed
then these gods proceeded
she took care of its refugees
he took flight through fear of you
is it the truth what they say
upon his throne
that grow in punt
and his majesty said to the royal wife
an eternal memorial
this boat is large
he knows how to mend a severed head
you will not founder when you land
that comes from the offering table of the lord of all
to fetch provisions there for my children
and their wages were charged to the palace
i slew him with my axe
is called a spirit of hoarding
so you should take account of me
open hearted free of darkness
it is filled with offerings and sustenance
and they said to his majesty
you should say what you know how to explain
i brought to them their offerings
your light opens the eyes of the flock
exotic goods from the land of punt
and her children are in the cabinet
because he sees me carrying out your affairs
anyone who is experienced in it is keen sighted

as your children will last in your places
the king of upper and lower egypt nebtawire
and delicacies that you have allotted
nebkaure justified
the influence of a god
like the shining of the sun
mistress of all the gods
erecting on the fields of the lowland
who takes what he sees at will
and a mask of lapis lazuli
the king of upper and lower egypt maatkare
the spirit of the correct man is the spirit that brings happiness
if it is really him
united with the cavern of the one within everlasting time
another eye cream
and to drive off intrusion from the desert region
bowing to your majesty as i commanded
the god departed to his horizon
with amun is my steering oar
the west gives me pleasure
his sister said
and friends of today dont love each other
as to all which is in writing on the papyrus-roll hear it
when you have done everything that my majesty ordered
then they said to his majesty
they were more beautiful than that which had existed formerly
leader of the temples of the red crown
welcome to me
and uttered my war cry on his back
i have planned doing the useful deed
and this peasant came to plead with him for a fourth time
with a cabin
he created it as his monument for his father amun re
he is an excellent son
from the excellence of their phrasing
door keeper of the tempel and priest
i followed kings of upper egypt and kings of lower egypt
it is not a burden on your shoulders
the great god who expels disease demons
look misfortune is on every side
in year 23 second month of the season of growing day 19
who will disturb this tomb
go to elephantine
beloved friend of horus
to adore him
and have acknowledged that i am the rightful image of amun re
he is sekhmet against the one who transgresses what he has ordered
although i was not spat on
he reached his home in order that he could be with his brothers
as i have seen an example of his learning
and one did as everything that his majesty had ordered
the influence of a masculine pain demon the influence of a feminine pain demon
and he thrashed all his limbs with it
to seek distraction for myself
and praised by ankh re
hidden from the troglodytes and foreigners
and the islands of the sea
you are pure of habit
on the myrrh terraces of punt
an illness has seized her body
look they have fled to the desert
the enemy staggers because of its might
and she said to me
and another will come
who subjugates the lands at the ends of the world
in order to placate them
then his people and his cattle were pursued
may he live forever
on which one may rely
her uncle then went to tell this to ruddjedet
and remain in the mouths of the living
glorious seed of the almighty
the total number thereof was 170 bulls
together with its inhabitants
hearts have become greedy
it is bringing of tears
and something harmful to whoever transgresses it
hearts are greedy
then they sleep as in the state of death
at the head of his entire army
khons in thebes neferhotep
one will slaughter for you at the entrance of your tomb
who will pass this tomb chapel
who judges without being partial
perish in a pond surrounded at night by crocodiles
they know that i am their lord
brought as booty of his majesty
to whom is brought cedar from lebanon
knowing my vigilance
like re forever
they advanced their hearts being bold
of the first generation
a mortal man dies along with his underlings
its people are your servants
to wade in their blood as far as herakleopolis
is what is on your mind of greater concern to you
conducted it safely to egypt
she did everything that a queen should do
like those of weary ones
embrace his agency in your hearts
my soul is ignorant about easing the misery that is due to life
my house and everything that is in it
i acted as loving son
then my majesty ordered that they be made to swear an oath
and see your house
the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperkare may he live forever
he does what is right
says he namely atum
he remains as lord
i kept alive the names of my forefathers
so this god spent three years and nine months in bakhtan
i did this again for
sphinxes of silver
look you surpass the lady of pestilence
and there is no mans heart
together with tributes of all foreign lands
beneficent mother
beating time for the troop
he then awoke in fear
the quality of a son of a someone is good for him
the inhabitants of the aegean sea and the rebellious lands
this is the precept
then her neck was cut
etc
he gave me the land in its length and its breadth
they present her with their children
with fat bulls and fat cows
among your relatives
then he payed tribute to his majesty
then he said to me
lord of every foreign land
treasurer
they havent been brought
possessor of veneration venerable
and he doesnt look at his belly
with the favour of the king lasting and enduring
there is no road to me
its large door from asian copper
and found her eldest uncle on her mothers side
until the road and its traveller were separated
may she enfold your head
because i am very skilled in strength and victory
no one knows what is coming when planning tomorrow
his son amenemhet
all health all joy
counts were appointed in front

leader of everything in this entire land

it is bringing of tears
excellent god
people say but why did he break that rule
if you wont do it she wont do it
lord of the foreign lands chief of the troglodytes
his corpse will be something cast into the water
to the ends of this world
then this peasant came
the officials ushered me while i hurried
it is your spirit good god lord of the two lands
but your name still lives
it is that there is fright in my body
after he had reached the residence
then isis placed herself before her
like a mans coming home from an expedition
may khons defend me a true scribe
but you are sated with your bread
two necklaces
my soul will be glorified after my death
and this peasant was afraid
send a message to him
i put the fame of your majesty throughout the nine bows
horus mighty bull appearing in thebes
i investigated what could be useful for this
then my majesty ordered that they be granted passage
until she arrived at this august mountain
fenugreek
he united for me the black land and the red land
who will enter this tomb
and none light of heart who is weighty of thought
one who should hear deaf
his majesty ordered that khons the provider in thebes be made to proceed
i speak so that you will hear
you will not find a place on which you can rest in the west
beseeching my majesty saying
how good it is for the palace
unique confidant
while your statues remained in the temple in the following of the great god
investigating what was of old
none speechless whose mouth you opened
i have found a peasant whose property has been stolen
with the exception of one of these children of the ruler of vile kush
fright of my majesty to the southern boundary marker
you trample all foreign lands
and found him standing with his kilt upside down
who appeared as king of upper and lower egypt
give us life from you
like a ship without a captain
mut mistress of asheru lady of all the gods
the bedouin of asia are subject to my majesty
and captor
whom victory was foretold as he came from the womb
i surpassed what had been done before
he created it as his monument for his father amun re
his first wife
and to let them see your majesty as avenger
the appeaser is causing misery
as for him who is enriched by it
and this peasant came to plead with him for an eighth time
and you will catch fatted fowl
while the fool is pressed down
whereas its old troops have entered into citizenship
and trees that always carry fresh myrrh
i shall return to the place i came from
and slept on a bed
or anything good that may be done with them
and when i set sail
he said it to him after sitting upon his great throne
heir of horus in his two lands
about whom a lie has been told involving a man
in the time of your forefather nebka justified
but he gave them to a friend of his and it was he who gave them to him
ahhotep
to be made to a cake
one great of strength like the son of nut
whereas brutality is for the criminal
cooked in ointment
in writing
the prince of bakhtan rejoiced very greatly
making the lower chapel for myself
has stiff cervical vertebrae
then a star fell
the servant of this wab priest bathes herself in the pool with all his daughters
i saw construction of a magnificent ship
given life like re forever
who had come to its aid
excellent image of the divine body
and a thunderstorm before it happened
with limitless people and horses
when your grave is made
all required equipment to be put in a tomb shaft was supplied therein
and have acknowledged that i am the rightful image of amun re
i reached the old age of the honoured elders
then i came out of the cabinet
two ladies who rejoices in truth
my majesty devastated them
the overseer of the masons of the pyramid
their utterances concerned the praises and favours towards me
one who has nothing
the man is in the house
he found six persons
no one will contest but who can know it
together with everyone in bakhtan
o great god equal of re
a royal offering
who was fashioned by the lords of the great house
my speech is done
the enemy failed
royal seal keeper
and every official
to hut sehotepibre
for i knew that you are content with justice
so that you may do her every good deed in the necropolis
summon to me swift nimble messengers
then it is ground
look i am in distress
for lack of an intimate friend
prince hordedef said
1/4 dates
i was its foremost on the day of its battle
he saw her coming
lapis lazuli
this wonder that happened to his majesty
from the southern provinces of upper egypt
in the tree garden around my temple
and clothes to the bedouin
whom valor was given while he was in the egg
and the prince of bakhtan organized a day of celebration for them
after he had gone to miu
in order to be given the breath of life
yours is what the sun revolves around
and his fate brought on his doom
a vessel of gold
shelter dont let the crocodile snatch
now my majesty had a statue of my majesty made
oxen
there can be no sleep for the lone man
this flight that the servant made
now i have spoken out against the aggressor
if moments of praising arise
for the spirit of
when goodness is good goodness is good indeed
to be ground
to be eaten for one day
whom can i talk to today
when the pubic area is painful
i came to let you crush the aegean islanders
look you are a herdsman
the sacred figure thereon made from gold
who was loyal to his benefactor
royal confidant
high steward my lord greatest of the great
for the division of plots of land
it is parrying a thing before shooting
the two banks say
as bread and beer for every day

it is known
in the land where you were born
of a dead man or dead woman
my soul is ignorant about easing the misery that is due to life
lacuna in text
a man who complains does he return to you next year

the two lands were under her direction
i came to let you crush the border people
show character do not pass on your weaknesses

he who should relieve distress is ordering its creation
a star fell falling to their south
because of the greatness of the might of his majesty
the cabinet of the palace assembled

four necklaces
a sure marksman
i am like your hounds
and the prince of bakhtan organized a day of celebration for them
many craftsmen rebuilt it
royal seal keeper and sole companion
took me in his arms
i am a possessor of beauty

your lips
which was wrong to his heart
may you perish
look a wonder that happened
i deprived their noses of the breath of life
acquaintance of the king and his cabinet
whose great ones have one greater
one great of strength like the son of nut
have djedi assigned to the house of prince hordedef
my father gave them to me
and he went up higher
for there is no brute who attains excellence
heir who prospers by the favour of the sovereign our lord
that you are on earth
and tows the transport
slaughter is what spreads respect for him
perfect of births
year 9 under the majesty of

pigeons
and his first arrow stuck in the chest of that enemy
it contains all good things
the great god of the primordial time
as to anyone who does not know this spell he shall never enter
he came across a man standing on the embankment
with excellent plans
then his majesty said
i crouched down in a bush
any commoner

i carried off their underlings
he erected his stela there
those in your city
of hides of upper egyptian panthers
then the prince of bakhtan had his gifts sent
hurry and bring me a cape from my house
of gold four rings
whether i am at home or in this place
until it becomes dead matter
i opened my mouth to my soul
he has no children and no heirs on earth
their altars were bare
the number brought by his majesty from the hunt on this day was 56 bulls
then they presented him with their menits and sistra
to whom great ones of busiris come
who will pass by this monument
see with your own eyes
while his majesty was in thebes the victorious mistress of cities
one didnt run after me
because it is more beneficial to him who does it than to him for whom it is done
whom the king of upper egypt elevated
with mucus in his neck
who attacks one who would attack
the children of the steward
their corpses
and dismiss the west
and they were put on carts
without coming out
for the life prosperity and health of her majesty
but who is there is a god who lives
and was appointed to be chief of upper egypt

and found bentresh possessed by a spirit
powerful of strength
that you be remembered
he attackes every land with his strength
he entrusted to her the heritage of the two lands
and arriving safely at the district of shetep
and he had a wife called meret
his majesty was saved by his great strength
have you travelled on water or on land
lord of the throne of the two lands at his beautiful feast of luxor
let me spend many years
prince regent and count
relying on the numerous troops
to the house of khons in thebes neferhotep
and stand at the tomb shaft on the day of burial
it is a turning point of life
apart from a nubian who shall come to trade in mirgissa
without crowds behind him
the 5th time
troops being with you
and protect the poor
only a fool complains about it
and this peasant came to plead with him for a fifth time
then the majesty of this great god ordered
the spear of a hothead flies past
creator of what the earth produces
and sustenance
then he said to me
this was written down in year 1 third month of the season of growing

as a sender in whom are divine limbs
at the approach of whose statues the people and the gods were rejoicing
and restores mounds that have been ravaged

every priest

my majesty ordered the creation of the large bark on the river
then ruddjedet said
for you are a father to the orphan
we administered great monuments
and they proceeded to where they had come from
then prince chephren stood up to speak and said

and the fathers and mothers who were with me
and i am your servant
for whom there is no escape from the west
musicians preceding you
see what is the remedy for the dream

who hastens
great is the fear of you
my majesty sends you to do this
to adore him
a hundred jars of beer
the vigilant leader of the lord of the two lands
who keeps his name alive
magnifying his victories to let his valour be related
to you belongs gold
and he said to them come in
to the hall keeper imenyankhren
who developed his beauty in the body of niut
says
there is release for the ka with the one who shows love for him
the west is celebrating
or anything good that may be done with them
lord of the horizon dwellers
who follows his lord in his strides
then his majesty said to him
lord of the thrones of the two lands
which means it is made to thrive
you have no unfulfilled wish
to steal the cattle behind these fortresses
i damaged his towns and his people
and from the south of wabut
it is positions that produce offerings
on which a god lives
whose supporters celebrated a triumph through him
he led millions of subjects
this excellent god
let me make your name in this land according to every good rule
i was one who was calm with the angry
while this expedition of the king was watching
and i will find him
without millions of men behind him
everywhere
it is more than exaggeration
then these gods were brought
justified
the crew of re is driving in their mooring post
let him not speak ill of you before you have heard
a king who is lauded for his arms in battle
o those who will pass by this stela
his first wife
to judge between litigants
which endure on earth
dont fend off someone who appeals to you
look the boat is on the ground
the one who goes out under his kin is a miserable man
setting off on a good journey to the gods land
in the service of the house of gold
thus the god acted to be merciful
i will let this god stay here in bakhtan
while he has pain in his stomach
count
as your children remain in your places
when he came from naharina
these things which i have given to these priests
made longer and wider than before

they have conspired against me
making a man sad

but it is a sweet breath from your entrails
i placed myself on my belly
and prince hordedef said
in order to reach for a life as you described

about whom a lie has been told involving a man
an evil deed cannot reach harbour
and now we have come back safely
vice chairman of vice chairmen

menkheperre may he live eternally is the one who opens the way as something perfect
free of insolence

he went to heaven
he placed my might in upper retjenu
and she was sacrified on it as burnt offering

that i could walk freely in his camp
set fire to it
a resting place
i have fetched you
your father is eating bread
and the festivals of the seasons
four times
what he didnt know before
and there is no mans heart
in order to see it
yet officials should be people who dispel injustice
my heart was not in my body
look i will come
the mouth that calms in the entire land
look you are a hunter who slakes his desire
it will be useful for you
and i rescued those who were far away from the foreigners
you will be happy here with me
his bones were strong his limbs were destined to be of gold
the sun rises for your sake
to bring him his hearts desire
anywhere you may enter
and felled all their trees and all their fruit trees
you are re lord of heaven with your courtiers
but provide sustenance for the wife of this peasant
i will go to petition on account of you to anubis
and returned the parts of water of the lake to their positions
may your majesty do as he wishes
everything that comes before my majesty through trade is his
its quantity without limit
my name reeks through you
do not be jealous of what is not your due
it is the eater who tastes so one who is questioned replies
with making them countless
content in the place of eternity
on this august mountain
what my soul said to me
and the northerners come bowing to my might
and all good and pure things on which a god lives
you created your body
concerning their opposing a briber
as done for the kings children
patience is the monument of a man
two necklaces of gold
then he took a rod of fresh tamarisk to him
it came to you by the gifts of the god
and all festivals of heaven and earth
two ladies shining as a flame great of strength
go to elephantine
like re forever
there is no road to me
does the hand balance err
as a sender in whom are divine limbs
and of labourers and their children
bend your arms and bow
narw birds
is acting corruptly thereby
foremost of karnak
and he does the matter that angers you about him
i will alight when you become weary
as from the might of the great one
that the braided in heliopolis grind this haematite
of this temple of osiris
he doesnt let laziness near his heart
but prepare for me the six heqat of barley
and drink as i please
o my comrade
that it is you who gave them to him
the inhabitants of the aegean sea
founded by horus
dont become a flood against the suppliant
like a mans grasping thereby
then one of the donkeys filled
and khnum made his limbs healthy
and this peasant said
officials
he told me this
the house of the scribe
i have come here to summon you by order
the rooms of the house
which endure on earth
entrusted to me
his opponants will be beneath

uproar in the northern sky

beetle who raised himself
a monument built by his brother

i captured their women
as he sailed southward to khent hen nefer

and these were brought from there to your fathers the kings of lower egypt
your tongue is the pointer of the balance

it was he who subjugated the foreign lands
have you come to cause silence
he who should punish injustice is doing evil
he has restored what was in ruins
patient craftsman
then this humble servant sailed southward
`i was administrator in your harem
the horizon is in another land
and my name was not heard from the mouth of a herald
and there is no word of exaggeration therein
while her eyes looked back
he is the son of osiris
by the goddess
i established you in my sanctuary and i performed wonders for you
i seized the southerners under the command of his spirit
that he flees on the day of suffering
i have given you all life and dominion
son of re of his body his beloved lord of every foreign land
i let many ships be constructed of cedar
his heir to whom his throne was given
and this peasant came to plead with him for an eighth time
i have given you punt in its entirety including the lands of the gods

and very early the next morning
all kinds of precious stones
justified
as he reports the words of the king to his nobles
look you are a hawk to the people
when i uncovered my face
his majesty perceived the conspiring that was done against him by mankind
vizier leader of all the officials of the judicial office
chief of the two lands
a major who accepts bribes
as my father praises me
accompanied by laden ships
to its entirety
his majesty ordered that khons the provider in thebes be made to proceed
but it is found with handmaidens at their mill-stones
my name was good in the entire land
and restrains me from death
and turn into worms
you say
so that his majesty might bring them to thebes
he came from the womb with me
deputy of the overseer of works of heliopolis in upper egypt
please give this barley to your bearer
in menat khufu

as soon as the commoner has gone into the pool
whom valor was given while he was in the egg

the overseer of the seal makers
without pause in your labour
examinor of mankind
whereas my soul has not quarrelled with me before

and recited to the priests
according to this state that i was in

of exceedingly great weight
if there is a lack of it poverty takes power
as son of a count into the inheritance

knowing my vigilance
after i will have entered the myrrh terraces

ruler of egypt
since he might stay silent for you on day one
in the time of the lord of the two lands nebpehtire justified
and his majesty l.p.h. said to those in his retinue

to the kings who were before
calling each of them by his name

like a praise singer does
i raised the orphan without a father
as he had foretold previously
an incense jar of gold
the leader of the city and vizier ptahhotep says
lady in waiting
since your eye is on those who scheme against you
until they came out
your pillars will be built of limestone
for whom the lord of the gods sanctified the hebset festival
governors were appointed to judge
a castle of iron
but you are sated with your bread
my tribe and all my property were in his hands

and her gaze was pleased by it
i perpetuated the name of my father
and he shall bring his courtiers with him
you are ra lord of the heavens
the king of upper and lower egypt nebukaure
the bedouin who were preparing to fight and to oppose the rulers of the lands

for the first doorway of the tomb
every office is under his command
to be ruler of input
and his majesty built monuments for the gods
there is no one who has returned from there
each man controlling his tribe
truly righteous
the wise man is famed for what he has learned
i took the crops away from them
and every good thing from the gods land
he gives him knowledge
his eyes see after every body
for lack of a survivor
with which i could rob the goods of this peasant
more than a diligent child
may it attend to me in this
childhood
may he live forever
i came to let you crush the boundaries of the world
and weret hekau
while his glowing breath attacks them with fire
when the second day dawned
and perish
their utterances concerned the praises and favours towards me
with lapis lazuli and turquoise
i let you hear
so they are good too for burial
give your magical protection to him
he got to know my excellence before his friends
because his father amun loved him so much
and so it happened that she disrupted her side
and the fathers and mothers who were with me
do not deviate but operate the rudder pull on the tiller rope
have attached your necks
you cannot come up
what the sun revolves around is in my grasp
while they see their lord
raised by bedouin

greeting o prince
i was appointed as count and overseer of the storehouses
for his son nebtawire
i stretched out my own hands
8 acacia trees
who controls every foreign land
who were following him in this army
never happened the like to servants whom their lords had praised
drinking water from the watering place
year 10 first month of the season of harvest day 1
the like had not happened before
you satisfy my heart at every moment
that he might celebrate millions of sed festivals
and the misery from them has been pacified
the infantry was in joy
shall i now be robbed in his district
it is self seeking
in captivity
the other under barley
without pause in your labour
when he was a child at his mothers breast
great of fame
suppressing mercy
foremost of those in the west
a good ruler who does what is beneficial to his father and all gods
i have said this without boasting and without lie
by nebet imhet
a thousand oxen
my majesty subjugated every land

when falsehood sets out it goes astray
but if you restrain me from a death
my neglectful brother
lord of the thrones of the two lands
he came from the womb with me
his northern to that reversed water flowing south
and it is full of all good things
the place where the sound was made
plated with electrum
from taseti
whom can i talk to today
more sacred than what is in heaven
do not raise your voice peasant
dont disregard someone you know
who is among the gods
he loads his harvest into a boat
those who are on earth and those who will be
the slaying is not repeated
cheating diminishes justice so render good account
may hearing enter him and all sincerity
and ties your things to their proper place
southern boundary made in year 8 under the majesty of

he is a brave bull
you are greedy but it does nothing for you
i am a noble to be heard
who tires himself greatly
upwawet of upper egypt
it is the older princess who unites with the white crown
youths stood in line
the influence of a masculine pain demon
i was not full of resentments towards the great ones in the palace
who rescues egypt on the battlefield
who takes care of egypt
his pure place of enjoyment
to have this sleeping potion poured out
who will perform this magisterial office in this entire land
true son of thoth
he is bast she who protects the two lands
revered
to reach the smeller with its retort
every room of the palace l.p.h. to seek distraction for himself
at the stairway of the great god lord of abydos
tjenenut
who possesses bread should be merciful
who is remembered for his successful deeds
it is to be mixed together
and she was sacrified on it as burnt offering
an evil deed cannot reach harbour
then i followed the sovereign l.p.h. on foot
male slave pamedjai
it is the small minded that seize riches
what the sky gives
he is mighty of arm
this goddess returned after she had slain mankind in the desert
yet you have become a transgressor
in my function of initiated
primordial one
with delightful fields in the right place
to the mayor of the wadi natrun
i was served from the table of the king
why is this mentioned
the accuser becomes wretched
his majesty returned from kush having overthrown his enemies
may this humble servant be ordered to appoint a staff of old age
who is praised by his god does not pilfer
except for the barley of these musicians
that dough is to be placed in it
to plead with
the flight was made through terror of you
after i had cleared the path for the god
the fish of the waterside speak to them
whom he raised over his nobles
and who will say
as was done for the father of my mother
the primeval one of the two lands
that you cannot be prudent
one steals
i directed the works on the neshmet barque
i returned southward to egypt
a great lump of incense
pass judgement yourself son of meru
my soul opened his mouth to me
they will perform this magisterial office in this entire land
then my majesty ordered that they be made to swear an oath
all many priests
one will not hear your name
after i had been honoured before his courtiers
and fashioned its cordage
you are alive
a king who will perform the kingship in this entire land
pitching camp of the envoy of the king and his expedition
i was bestowed another favour of the king
you were born to him
we were 75 serpents in all with my children and my relatives
i opened my barn to everyone
whose southern borders reach to the crest of the world
foremost of karnak
who was preparing a period of hostility
to cross that great river
the hall keeper sesostris
i endowed him with fields and servants
of a dead man or dead woman
this nemtinakht then said to a servant of his
the divine council upon the flood
for the kingship of the two banks of horus
given life
min horus in the midst of the lands
and to let them see your majesty as a young bull
summon to me my eye and shu tefnut geb nut
but provide sustenance for the wife of this peasant
12 vines
to be made to a cake
like sitting on the shore of drunkenness
bakhtan is your home
he tells on to the children
at the great burning and at the little burning
over whom nemti rejoices
one armlet
your servant is in a state of joy on account of your words
without equal
go and measure for me the barley
that entire estate of his
for her labour is difficult
of gold two battle axes
another remedy for making a child urinate
or any form of incense
is my upper egyptian barley to be a path for you
they are offered bread beer wine meat fruit
and i was given the captives for slaves
great god
i gave you valour and strength against all foreign lands
during this that khons the provider in thebes and the spirit did
but who is there is a wise man
of the finest of his land
and the next day
kay son of nehri justified
it is large
summon to me swift nimble messengers
but if you restrain me from a death
o living who are on earth
i will go to heaven
let the eyes see so that the heart be informed
divine nest of horus
my majesty subjugated every land
this was copied from start to finish as found in writing
none ignorant whom you let know
he created the son of re tuthmosis ruler of thebes
but without letting a ship of the nubians pass
all my serfs and my cattle
that he may be given very much life
but if it expels itself
hear divine fathers of this temple
whose coming is awaited by the courtiers
that sails north past abu sir forever
in whose belly urine is constricted
who says what is good
he led millions of subjects
as to this grave
they are the lords of heaven
if you go down to the lake of truth
behold i have written commending thee to the steward
horus mighty bull beloved of maat
in karnak
all pure things are pure
as was the desire of her majesty about it
you will never die in a foreign land
and they locked the room with her and them in it
he says it for him
the schemers of evil
foremost of those in the west
like of sekhmet in a year of pestilence
but it isnt known
more accurate than a plummet
and the brother with whom one dealt
during the first expedition
the king of upper and lower egypt djeserkare gave me
its form unknown
on which a god lives
fool look you are found out
after i will have guided them by water and by land
then my majesty erected my stela on that mountain of naharina
more than the smell of fishermen
while the lord of a clan may beg to be followed
troops being with you
united with the sun
son of re of his body his beloved
maa wood like alabaster for supply to the residence
every feast of the happy living and of the dead
a good plan
and was very frightened
for his father amun
look that is what they do to peasants of theirs
a herdsman of evil brings misery to his cattle
o tomb
to be put on the eye lids
or the influence of anything bad
your heaven who is in my palace
my father likes bread more than honey
every embalmer of anubis
in his 2nd position
and the fields were flooded three palms high with the liquid
is there not a pavilion in the garden of ubainer
o wisest of all mankind
count
the fright of my lord was in my heart
and also my god nun
and him who was on it as captive
another remedy for curing
given life stability and dominion like re forever
or climbed over his walls
the shares of horus and seth
at every embankment
the belongings of a pauper are his breath
the high steward rensi son of meru then went
i have come to you sovereign lord
then she uttered a very great cry
on account of the wickedness of what was done to him
while the kingship of the two lands
that dough is to be placed in it
to the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt snofru
see it is the ka that loves to listen
that we may live on the breath that he gives
have attached your necks
his boat cannot moor in its harbour
and you are strong
i was praised
if you wont do it she wont do it
beloved of thoth
the king of upper and lower egypt nebpehtire justified
so that he makes the odour of the temple sweet
join with your majesty in your hearts
and so he went
without putting it
who created mankind the king of the people
look the god has let you live
he slew seven lions by shooting in an instant
and found him emerging from the gate of the temple of arsaphes
for the deputy of the overseer of works peniati
day 15
the foreigners of retjenu will not rebel again
the puntites unknown to egyptians
the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperkare justified
there is indeed no boasting therein
so you say
a messenger who came north or went south to the residence
beloved of amun re bull of his mother
and you will make another soul who is hot envious
shall i spend all day at it
sealed chest
the mild man receives more respect than the strong
he subjugated and they acknowledge my lord
how excellent is this plan in my opinion my lord
raise him up
who races
there is no enemy of mine in the southern lands
and i slept in a shelter of wood
see the boat is in the water as the sun shines forth in the horizon
splendid place since the time of osiris
i tied up the nubian nomads by tens of thousands and thousands
i would say to someone who is about to go
i do not know who brought me to this country
and meanwhile his wife and his children
those who built in granite
by the overseer of the works of amun suti
before the people
it seemed to him like heaven
son of re of his body
of the first generation
while he rushes between the barbarians as a star that crosses the sky
building their sanctuaries anew
before i have come to it
and set me down without harming me
lord of the two lands
and his majesty carried out a large massacre among them
his majesty offered an example thereof in the temple of amun
whom valor was given while he was in the egg
and to let them see your majesty equipped with your regalia
a daily supply of wine
who brought you who brought you young man
the king of upper and lower egypt lord of the two lands aakheperkare given life
a lord of followers is great in respect
i will not let you take him from me
you live as long as the superior is pleased with you
knowing what is said
while proceeding to the land of djahi
and every kind of precious stone
about your beautiful arrival at my temple
kissing the ground for the foremost of those in the west
took me in his arms
is under your command
that he might present his issue before the father of the eldest
creator who wasnt created
and all kinds of fine vegetables
the god who formed my ba
the influence of a god
then his majesty said to khons in thebes neferhotep
by the pronouncement that issued from the mouth of the majesty of
he fashioned his father amun on thirteen carrying poles
we come and let his children after him prosper
through his excellent plans
copy of the decree brought to this humble servant
you created your body
will you then not allow us to pass on the path
accurately spelled
lord of the two lands
this is the norm of the divine word
glory and might sustenance and wealth
that they may rush like a bodys shadow
and the prince of bakhtan came with his army and his officials
joined and united by the word of your majesty
then re said to nun
its water its fields its tamarisks and its sand
that a good event may occur
to the place where i came into being
he built his monuments in input
as you do this your bodies will be well
then aata came to the south
without your taking care
pure of food offering
one who was happy becomes anxious
may he live forever
and most august than they who created him
while the kingship of the two lands
forever and ever
but it does not make one tired
how well it goes for him with this advice in his heart every day
welcome in peace o gracious one
i am a well born man beyond reproach
you have not cursed that one should reprove your speech
the enemy staggers because of its might
his beloved
he is the unique gift of god
djehuti hotep
in victory and in triumph
on account of bentresh
the place where the sound was made
who judges without being partial
then re said to nun
who was free of mercilessness
i gave praise on the shore to the lord of this island
never happened the like to servants whom their lords had praised
son of re of his body
horus knew me in his house
who carries out a massacre of the bedouin tribes of asia
who rescues egypt on the battlefield
and he who should mitigate is causing suffering
it was staffed with people
begetter who creates mankind
while he has pain
in his neck
after i had seen that you had an excellent character
hearing is good as speech is good
is the stand balance biased
and much gold from wawat
he appointed me as chief of construction in order that i might build great monuments for him
my legs have ceased to walk
for it is mighty
sehetepibre
how can this be done for a servant
concealment
the house is in the city
he created it as his monument for his father amun re
another remedy for making urine come out
i established my border further south than my forefathers
then the high steward rensi son of meru delivered them
given life like re forever
when it had been read to me
then he created magical protection for khons the provider in thebes
has appeared as king of upper and lower egypt
may you abandon this neglect
who smites the nomads of nubia
do not attack one who cannot attack
and crossed the water carrying him
prince turi
5 fig trees
i took thought for posterity
more than the smell of ducks
faces are blank
instruct the great in what is useful for him
and your heirs established in your positions
in a jar
everytime he takes aim
i have given you all life and dominion from me all stability from me
then the high steward rensi son of meru said
and they came in peace to karnak
born of useretsat
i will not mention to you the youngest daughter
cast evil on the ground
forever and ever
then that boat came
forever and ever
the road on which it travelled was exceedingly difficult
did you descend on the road of heaven
that his majesty did continuously
the god entered into his horizon
the influence of a feminine pain demon
an eternal memorial
my majesty myself says
while my children became strong
you say
it is the official who is after good conduct
begotten by it
and khnum was with them carrying luggage
which my majesty had carried off in victory
since the god of those who had received the white crown
to do something that pleases my father osiris
then she put her ear to the sack
of bread
vizier of horus in his appearances
the princes of retjenu dragged these flag poles
since im coming to sit in it
male slave kharai
incapable of communication
your yards will not break
giver of life dont let people die
i am free of fate
oxen
i made the ship of another descend
his sacred image being of electrum lapis lazuli turquoise
now ill speak again to you so hear people
he knew my eloquence while my appearance was youthful
look you are a policeman who steals
until his urine comes out
the daughter says that thing to the son
and every office of the palace were united behind me
and to water everlasting doom
incapable of communication
greatest of the companions
like when the sky becomes calm after a heavy storm
and this child rushed into her arms a baby of one cubit
who was free of mercilessness
i was honoured with the king
my brother
to prepare the road for it
he was a falcon of gold and flew to the sky toward egypt
whose position atum advanced
thinking it was done to punish him
since i didnt intend to become involved in contention
over whom nemti rejoices
so that mankind doesnt see and lose heart
and my heart is laden with grief
their districts were massacred
bringing of every good thing from the palace l.p.h.
it was his majesty who opened its road
i am his son
and to give goods to those who were loyal to him
who eradicates them
foster his image in the sight of people
not a man perished
but that fat of my body
the eyes are weak the ears have become deaf
there will be no poor man alive
but the hindermost will reach land
with bedouin locks
he has no children and no heirs on earth
my giving the road to my feet going north
how excellent is this plan in my opinion my lord
count
now i was standing by and heard his voice
i overthrew them as he ordered in the way that he used to do
brothers are evil
her arms
praised by all her gods
in addition to what the kings children gave
and may the two banks serve you
for a sarcophagus
all their coats of mail
he did something new in his mountainous land
of bread beer libation wine incense and meat offering
a thousand of alabaster
or the influence of anything bad
is no more
as that of min in a year when he comes
do not pass by my form do not stray from my talent
let me carry out his many expeditions
to be eaten for one day
no equal to him has been found warrior hero on the battlefield
he has given you every land
the name of her mother is tjuia
excluding the prisoners that i brought from kush
she will give birth
to let you know that your roving through lands
a woman that i know
similarly if one prayed to any goddess
then he will pass it
if it is a stand balance
it is his sister
after confinement
unet is celebrating
then the spirit went in peace to where he wished
and protect the poor
then this goddess came in the early morning
who was in charge of the garden to say
said by the man of the elite foremost of arm
a man remembers a bad thing but does not know the good therein
how good it is
and it acquired all kinds of things
until you have completed four months on this island
bowing to his uraeus
these women
that one came to say to his majesty
he placed me at the head of his children
no equal to him has been found warrior hero on the battlefield
on the offering table
any learned man
that he might be alive
and the council of the residence
a mans goodness is his monument
for his father min lord of the foreign lands
brothers are evil
his daughter
he is stout hearted when he attacks the easterners
i opened my barn to everyone
but i know the place where it is kept
then she heard the noise of singing music making dancing cheering
leader of the administration of the lord of the two lands
i was one who was correct like a balance
and customs houses were established on the river
chief seal keeper
slacken your bow
a good boat
mistress of the palace
in understanding one who serves him
pitching camp of the envoy of the king and his expedition
gold horus great of strength who smites the asiatics
the king of upper and lower egypt lord of the two lands nebpehtire
i shall have them bring you ladanum malabathrum
and they fled immediately
as a favour of the sovereign
who is here with you
dont listen to the heart
who will pass this stela of mine
begotten by the god with the secret name
that one should oppose your utterances
who knew which phrase could make people angry
exotic goods were brought
the king of upper and lower egypt khakaure
and instructions were heard from the great throne
begotten by count sobek nekhet justified
the primeval one of the two lands
like when satiety comes and ends hunger
a thousand of offerings
pressing it is an offence to the ka
as something to good effect before your workers
we were found on the road by a servant of our good lord who had been sent from the palace
he is a king valiant like montu
i built a monument within my city
slaughter is what spreads respect for him
every man is embracing his fellow
i adorned his great barque for all eternity
and fasten on the agency of those who do
do not turn pale
beauty of every day
purify yourself in his name
he again did for me a very brave act
you have not cursed and nothing you said was reproved
making for him a resting place of eternity
going north or south
with mucus in his neck
and to let them see your majesty as a crocodile
now the house of this nemtinakht was at a waterside path
but it was not in my heart against you
bringing the best of the offering table
then it will be brought to us
then he was brought before his majesty with his gifts
who kept his name alive
he says
while his glowing breath attacks them with fire
these gods then went out
earth creates and the nile brings
the king of upper and lower egypt nebukaure
the king of upper and lower egypt lord of the two lands
this is my due from you
living again
good god son of amun
and then your majesty yourself will plant them
beer
and i induced cheers in the western deserts
whose plans do not fail
will have to say i snare against myself by my cleverness
i was rewarded with gold once more
his majesty commanded the digging of this canal after his finding it blocked up with stones
than those of any king who had been
and it will not happen due to him
to straighten out the land is to do justice
decree from the kings mother to the prince regent
he cannot reach land
so that she might achieve given life stability dominion
and to the inheritance of the father of my mother
a gale came up while we were at sea
who lets the god know his sanctuary
like water that quenches thirst
if thou harkenest to this that i have said to thee every plan of thine will go forward
an offering the king makes
if my soul listens to me
no one can escape from what is fated for him
lord of abydos
to seek out him who had rebelled against him in that land
the enemy failed
when your body is buried
and was very frightened
it measured the width of a loincloth
o wisest of all mankind
who went in peace
the man with power in a task turns about
two ladies who repeats birth
the daughter spoke to her father when she saw the sevant upon his donkey
for the spirit of
a protector who does not fear the rapacious
the hard man causes the end of his life
brave captor
the ennead in the great temple
and what one city had taken from another
more than the smell of bird droppings
with many tributes of gold and silver
ought me
beholding a stable with bulls oxen calves
concerning his being brought back to egypt
and earth envelops him
planning to seize my cattle
he crosses over to this city his daughter with him
at every embankment
pondweed
his lips are reliable when he is speaking
and you will go home with them
a refuge to the subjects
while her labour was difficult
who carries out a massacre of everyone
fine houses
i do not weep for that mother
plated with gold from the best of the foreign lands
bearing the beauty
i will not let you put silence into him
as you live for me
without my messenger being hindered
it severs the heads of the asiatics
give him praise like re
free of impatience
the dabhw fisherman is after paqr fish
without him knowing
and they said our stroke has become still without rowing
to build a monument for his father osiris
suppress your choice for the good of him who enters humbly
if the son is lazy there is still the wab priest
king of upper egypt in buto
hearing is good for the hearer
do justice to me
i shall return to the place i came from
like going outside
the lady of the heavens sees the horizon every day as she is in her sacred bark
then his majesty proclaimed concerning these wild bulls in their entirety
that was very narrow
daughter who subjugated the lords
who were crushed in the egg
if one prayed to a god to ask a thing of him
beware peasant
then i was cast on an island
as monuments of eternal age
and said
in your hereditary offices
a sure marksman
and who explored its every way
things are robbed by a criminal
had appeared on the horus throne
begotten by the priest seneb
for obstructed are going by night travelling by day
that is what they do
a troop of warriors of unet arriving in peace
my very many wonders are for you
then the spirit went in peace to where he wished
a righteous man whose righteousness has crumbled
lord of joy
in joy
you say
inspiring terror
as for any people
do not be light hearted for you are weighty
with limitless people and horses
the king of upper and lower egypt nebtawire

they all went on donkeys
made for you by your beloved son
she who comes from the darkness
the temple that his majesty built
whether they looked at the sky or looked at the land
if you meet an opponent in his moment
saying living death each day
and his majesty saw my valour
he opens up the creation
he is wisdom in the hearts
he guides the scribes to correctness
because he loved justice so much

he has conquered through love
and said to the prophet of khons the provider in thebes
while the kings children were giving me their hands
for my majesty sends you
but provide sustenance for his wife
when he erected two great obelisks in front of the temple
and this nemtinakht said
i spoke in truth

who has come with many gifts for the queen
arriving safely in the land of punt

then he bent his head down
overseer of the city vizier ptahhotep
there was no injury to an artisan
prince turi
two ladies who seized all lands
relying on the numerous troops
you dont have much myrrh
millions of times
he loads his harvest into a boat
your yards will not break
then he said to her
there was not a fool among them
do not make a loss on what is said
a good deed returns to its place of yesterday
and your house will be fixed on its goods
i will cause him to become acquainted with thy greatness
he who enters the foreign lands
your color is brighter than its hues
then he said to me
and had heard of my experience
look that is what they do to peasants of theirs
my character was very pleasing to his heart
again a wonder happened
none sleeping whom you roused
the only one of his kind
he opens valleys unknown to the ancestors
overseer of the granaries of amun

to gladden the heart of this humble servant
given life like re forever
with honey
your noble the one you love
who enters the turmoil of battle
with fearful hearts their bodies trembling
as commander of his army

seeing the monuments of their lords
after confinement
the islands of the people of wetnet being in the power of your might
his son priest of shau
1/16 water

and of the two pleasure ponds
and now they brought them as gifts to my majesty
the bedouin come to him carrying gifts
a good plan
you will spend month upon month
beginning of a remedy for curing
he who is knowledgeable like re
who brings advantage to its possessor
let the prince of bakhtan make a great offering before this spirit
who opposed you concerning your utterances
while restoring the northern like heaven
you crossed the water of the euphrates of naharina
you are taken away from leaping around
while maidservants grind barley for beer
the one he favours will be a lord of offerings
judge of nobility and subjects
so that his speech will be brought to us
hearts are greedy
pleading with this nemtinakht
ploughing
land gave me to land
look mankind which issued from my eye
o my comrade
the one who did justice
which sheds its flame in fire and emits its fragrance
as your king loves you
overseer of the granaries of amun
but he fled from his majesty to another land
for nine days
they entered megiddo
kamose
year 47 third month of the season of inundation day 10
landing in karnak
in joy
all foreign lands were united standing prepared to fight as one
after he had exercised kingship
10 cubits by 10 cubits on its every side
the stone was dragged by bulls that asiatics brought
so that i could see the temple of re lord of sakhbu
prince regent count sole companion
those abominated by god
how happy is he who can recount what he has experienced
to express the ointment of divine limbs
its children are cheering
may it please you
royal seal keeper
if it is crooked then you must be crooked
a thousand of bread beer
valuables from the treasury
son of re of his body
to slay the rebels who were there
giraffe tails
do not be proud on account of your knowledge
is dragging me toward death
look i am laden with sorrow
does not every plan succeed by it
the foreign land extracts for me everything good that is in it
he was found by his majesty at tent ta o
33/64 honey
then i placed myself on my belly
another scribe hears this plan
to the temples
a good crossing or not
it is not because of me
because of punishing the evil of one who does it
and subjugated naharina
look i am in your hands
my brother
to let you hear of the favour of the great kings wife
under whose seal the two gold houses are
while they lie in their blood
something good
whom can i talk to today
in qanefru nefru
overseer of works
then this peasant proceeded to wail very loudly
a balance that is crooked the pointer of a balance that errs
the mind has stopped and cannot remember the day before
now my majesty travelled to the ends of asia
when the day dawned on which mankind would be slain
retjenu is under my feet
and no one who draws his bow
in abydos
and i go out by day
of the rule of the father of my mother
he appointed me as chief of construction in order that i might build great monuments for him
to one who would tell me his concern
son of re of his body
a district overseer who should restrain robbery
you will not founder when you land
ra speaks concerning that thing
female slave istarajumi
deputy of the treasurer
the younger sister of queen nefrure
beer
their refuge
that you pass on your offices to your children
they could foretell a storm before it came and a tempest before it happened
may he live like re forever
how good is one instructed by his father
your ship will not lag
i commanded a mortuary offering
usermare sotpenre
mistess of the two lands
richest of the rich
and his terror protected their march
to be put on the eye lids
i mentioned each one of them by his name
there is nothing for contents here
when it is its pans that weigh things
and to let them see your majesty as a wild lion
prince regent
so you should inquire
may he live forever until eternity
true favourite of his lord
gold horus sacred of appearance mighty of strength
and had come wise from the womb
ahmose given life
beseeching my majesty saying
may they give a mortuary offering
then one of the donkeys filled
and all good and pure things on which a god lives
and she said
and to let them see your majesty as possessing the wings of horus
two ladies abiding in kingship like atum
he is horus with a powerful arm a excellent fortress to his army
his flame that drives away his enemies
the good god lord of rituals menkheperre
begotten by this humble servant in this place
the sight of the one who enters to report is keen
on the same day
and passing to blessedness
praised by the king of upper egypt
every scribe
but look what you are doing is supporting the thief
his eyes
he then said to me
in the land where i was born
you will delay him here
he will conquer southern lands
at the splendid jsd tree
and all good and pure things
do not be greedy over a share
act for him who acts for you
among their days of travelling south
and clothes end nakedness
and placed the gifts that the prince of bakhtan had given him of every good thing
then this goddess came in the early morning
hundreds of thousands of the finest of all foreign lands
may she fail what she came for
governors were appointed to judge
sole companion
and of labourers and their children
son of re amenophis ruler of thebes
to hut sehotepibre
lector priest
go and come back
khnumhotep son of khnumhotep son of nehri
before the people
amenhotep god and ruler of thebes
a thirsty mans approach of water
he saw her coming
for their blessed dead
but i couldnt find any
and most august than they who created him
a son who hears will be without any evils
give us your breath our lord
which the lord of the gods the lord of armant did for him
he left the land through terror of you
whom can i talk to today
the king of upper and lower egypt djeserkare justified
and 40 cubits wide

i became intimate with his majesty .]
under the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt menkheperre
great of sacrifice
initiated of amun re
gods father and beloved of the god
he is re by whose rays one sees
then king cheops justified said
galena
then this peasant said you beat me you rob my goods
hearts have become greedy
a great man when he is at a meal
i was taken to the ship the northern
lords of goodness
who builds monuments on his own initiative for his father amun
the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperkare image of aton
to avert agression
he said to me
and hor
may re horus and hathor love
you will say
the gods were turning away from this land
13 loaves of psn bread
hail to you celestial disk of the day
gold horus being
welcome in peace o gracious one
i thought this is the taste of death
the prince of bakhtan stood by with his army
he became rich in cattle
in joy
death is in my sight today
you should set yourself equal to these three
while you turn them into corpses throughout their valley
dug out was its lake
may he be given life like re eternally
my ladies what can i do for you
men as well as women are cheering him
who will disrespect your plans
rejoicing over his beautiful monument
absolutely everything
of bread beer oxen fowl
and he was placed on a couch of brick
so this god spent three years and nine months in bakhtan
that you arrive safely
standing at his gate
of khons the provider in thebes
yet there is none hasty of speech who is free of spluttering
whose arrows cannot miss
but if you flay him his thoughts turn to homelessness
on the day of the massacre by the good god
they are subservient to me as one
do not be mean in your character towards your friends
he had planned the timing of this event
their good child
look i am laden with sorrow
by a wave of the sea
if it is crooked then you must be crooked
to the ends of this world
of those who attacked him
like a ship without a captain
there was no complaint against me
my name reeks through you
ignoramus look you are questioned
when you take your place of eternity
the influence of a masculine pain demon the influence of a feminine pain demon
resist approaching the wife
as a great favour of the king
and the journey of my reaching the city of smiting the land
beloved of month lord of thebes
you have returned
heat as he wishes
beer
a royal offering will be given to you
i will create a breeze over your corpse
look you are a policeman who steals
only mouth that silences the mouths
he made me round up herds of elephants
yours is the sweet breath of the north wind
so i will arrange my rowing trip
he was appointed as a royal scribe
but can be found with the women at the grindstone
now that one has come to this humble servant
who sent my majesty to seize the lands and all foreigners together
and to punish the robber
infirmity has developed old age has befallen
who finds the right words
cause his wisdom to fall in front of his lord
but the weary of heart does not hear their cries
when his majesty arrived back in egypt
ameny son of amenyaa l.p.h.
is it suffering
such has not happened to other kings
something good
when it wasnt known yet
fear of me in the ends of asia
to be repeated by putting it
the hearer is one whom the god loves
the words of the officials follow it
and then well make harbour together
without your interment by barbarians
so that its hem came to rest on the water
and he arrived in the district of per fefi
to gladden my heart among them
which adorns the two lands through its beauty
you are like the messenger of khenty
with bread from the royal breakfast
creator of what the earth produces
for mercy has left you
like everything he had said
when it was reported to the royal herald
the sculptors carved
i will not speak
your hands upon something good
it is taking a man from his house
like those of weary ones
by the might of the majesty of this god
the king himself said to her
who fills my temple with remembrance of her love
youths from east unet
you will pass on your offices to your children
all kinds of good herbs of the gods land
but she did not turn back
foreign lands of metjen
attractive to the heart
he let me smite all foreigners
without an old age of coughing
and had come wise from the womb
so that the current ones were numerous
take years of life
for there is no brute who attains excellence
i will go and plead concerning you with anubis
when all snakes become hot
then two boats were made available to him together with their crew
and his majesty gave them to me for slaves
and your share of the cargo will be what you seize
he raised me over his nobles
to do what he did in the land
he found him an enemy whom one could fight
gold horus divine of appearance
fool look you are found out
see me having reached land
and made a burnt offering to the gods
shining of form in his youth
so that he keeps speaking remain silent
sesostris justified
grasp what is right by its likeness
and every man is stealing things from his fellow
a man of truth before the two lands
the man is in a state of joy upon seeing his fair daughter in his house
and their possessions as well
my praise was with his courtiers
everywhere
because their hearts are fearful about what i said to them
i was distinguished in monuments
and this djedi said
whom can i talk to today
that you be remembered
semen of the bull of truth
which was labour close to my heart
ra is with this man
whose justice has justice
which was consecrated after its place had been established
at last he sits down
it is the tethered bull that strikes the dueller
there are wild bulls on the hills of the district of shetep
his majesty returned every time
i will take you
menits vessels collars
then she drank and it pleased her heart
two ladies living of birth
and my heart was advanced more than the forefathers before me
but you do not hear it
each and every year eight ships
open the roads to the myrrh terraces
was let to ascend to heaven
another favour granted to me
look it is in this box
mighty of arms
do not speak falsehood for you are the balance
and his majesty ordered him to go to bakhtan with this messenger
with a beautiful bearing while walking
when he shoots at a copper target
and created magical protection for the daughter of the prince of bakhtan
as my father lives for me
on the sarcophagus of durable stone
now the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt kheperkare justified was told
the lord of life
this thing that the commoner had been doing in his house with his wife
and that is something that the chief lector priest djadjaemankh did
the man endures whose guideline is right
one steals
given life stability and dominion like re forever and ever
he divided the great river along its middle
and 317 women of her harem
to plead with him
and cast aside my misery
how lamentable is the poor man you ruin
female slave itnefer
now that this humble servant has come southward
and will tear down mendes
now my body is full of misery
one of those days
one constructs there for the palace l.p.h.
i was uninjured without force applied to me
he placed himself on his belly saying
making his monument
true and beloved acquaintance of the king follower sinuhe says
ornament of the mistress of heaven
the foreigners of retjenu will not rebel again
since dusk
and strike the heads of the asiatics of retjenu
so that you could crush the contentious and deceitful
may you not stay dark in her womb in this name of yours of keku
and load ships to the satisfaction of their hearts
until we return from making music in the north
while restoring the northern like heaven
this scribe speaks to that woman
one sinks low through greed
has become an enemy
now when his majesty arose as king
living again
you did not speak when your name was pronounced
then this nemtinakht said
may he live forever
you cannot fear him who submits it to you
o living who are on earth
how is it djedi that i havent been made to see you before
may he live forever
a 4 nw the 4th door
and my misery has ended up before you
and stand at the tomb shaft on the day of burial
and your environment is corrupt
who confronts the assembled nine bows
and he with whom one walked
then this spirit who was with her said to khons the provider in thebes
and said high steward my lord

think of the day of burial
another eye cream
and rub himself in
and that recorded be all your offices
lord of the crowns
3 maerua trees
so that you could crush the contentious and deceitful
by the envoy of the king
for four days
he ruled his city when he was an infant
when you are dead
at every seasonal festival
these were liegemen of the high steward rensi son of meru
i carried off its inhabitants
who strikes the southerners and beheads the northerners
i am his favorite servant
`i was administrator in your harem
in the necropolis
for he had seen my arms were proficient
my lord made me administrator of your monuments
may you give offerings upon a brazier
there are artists of words in the council
so i will eat your bread

ramesse beloved of amun
greatly feared in the mouths of the bedouin
what the nile brings from its source
act for him who acts to make him act
and the brother with whom one dealt
overseer of the administration
your heart is the weight and your lips are its arms
may he live forever
to be a resting place for my shade
or the influence of anything bad
as my majesty has recognized
given life
that day
who defeated the bedouin
revered
that is in this body of mine
nor is there casting of falsehood on the ground
and customs houses were established on the river
making the lower chapel for myself
that gave air to this colonnaded hall
aggression is valour
who created himself
for the revered
restoring their boundary markers like heaven
i do not weep for that mother
mighty of arm like horus
that my mother proceeded to become regentess and countess
the horizon is in another land
and his majesty brought him away as captive
saying
but he gave them to a friend of his and it was he who gave them to him
i set the dread of your majesty in their hearts
this is three times to induce him to act
and most august than they who created him
we come to bring it
which all the gods desire to live forever

so that i shall live on it
look you are the chief of a workhouse

the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperkare gave me
a joyful woman known to her town
instruct him in the words of the past
i tied up the nine bows
the high steward rensi son of meru gave them
to whom great ones come while they are bowing
like fire that cooks what is raw
and who do not neglect what they were commanded
like one who has not been ill
punish from the head teach by character
for whom all is done that she says
while they bowed their heads to the ground
fight on his name
ahmose nofret iry may she live forever
who destroys evil
for lack of a survivor
reached as far as the western lands
and all good things of the palace
until the moment that he returns to his house
it lies light on their hearts

of the servants of the kings of lower egypt
justified rai

in the residence of this city
he said high steward my lord
you can find it to be so for eternity
since the time of the god
and none of them is spared
and kings who had been before
a very strongly approving nod of the head

to make a complaint to you
ochre

and the fondness for me was before his companions
a good reward belongs to him who does it
as khons the provider in thebes had commanded
my name reeks through you
your sailing is steadfast under your majesty
one ox and a hundred bundles of vegetables
look doing something like that to the noble flock is not ordained
see what is before you is fine knowledge
after this tomb had been finished
i am the king great of strength
before his majesty
foremost of those in the west
and they presented them to his majesty
and a crocodile snatched her
so that his name might live in the mouths of the people
while his glowing breath attacks them with fire
to see the sun

then i was assigned to rising in memphis
praised by all her gods

he placed all of the foreign lands under your two feet to grant knowledge of his great strength

this peasant then said

a champion without equal
then a goose was brought to him and its head was cut off
he was not born to me

he measured 30 cubits
to startle you

following his word
whereas formerly the majesty of this noble god had been on eleven carrying poles
their districts were massacred

the woman pleased the heart of his majesty very much more than anything
heaven and all foreign lands created by the god are completely subservient to her
he is more fertile than the great flood
exotic goods were brought
you are hidden from their sight
but who is there is a wise man
a reward was given to the foreign land
of three digits in thickness
for doing is more useful to the doer than to the one for whom it is done
the second heliopolis in splendour
usermare sotpenre
i spent three days alone
look you are a dishonourable washerman
and revered
do not repeat slander
when you go down in the western mountain
who smashes the heads of the evil minded
a royal offering
not in untruth
explore the routes to punt
on the fifteenth day of the first month of the season of growing
they come to him with bowed heads
every man is robbing his fellow
and the monuments of its burial place were more excellent
all kinds of precious stones
the masons of the pyramid
he repelled evil
you receive praise from those you do not know
son of re of his body tuthmosis ruler of truth
that he might answer what i had said
during the first expedition

pleading with this nemtinakht
deputy of the treasurer
enduring king
its youths are refreshed
it was difficult in the opinion of the people who were dragging great things on it
and this peasant came to plead with him for a fourth time
he was a peasant of the wadi natrun
tuthmosis beautiful of form
planting love brings sustenance
that his majesty brought away from his victories
again i made a capture there and carried off a hand
given life forever
it happened because of the fame of his majesty
he perpetuated the name of his cabinet
he is going out
who eases pain
i was given male and female servants
and bring me haematite in great quantity
all protection and life with him
a man of virtue
as commander of his army
after he returned in strength in victory and in triumph
ten men came and ten men went
and i was assigned high fields and low fields
to be crushed with honey
as to this grave
if you are to be a leader
this goddess returned after she had slain mankind in the desert
lead it for him who knows that you have come forth from him
their refuge
more than sitting on sandbanks of crocodiles
leader of all that is not and all that is
with many tributes of gold and silver
a ship could not sail on it
honey
he saw this god come out of his chapel
who saw the face of khenty
keftiu and isy being in awe of you
then it is ground
he hears
beloved of the king
with oxen to the harbour
when i was in the primordial water
the boat is on the nile
who live by love of you
he will conquer southern lands
a miraculousness one each of his hours for the crown
they went before my majesty
as the monuments of your city gods will last for you
his name was nemtinakht
i am your father
three lions
from real cedar from lebanon
and presented them to his majesty
that one of these peasants comes here
without him giving anything thereof to his own house
one does not help now who has given help
of those who attacked him
and of those aboard none remained
officials are doing evil
and united with the gods
he sailed southward to khent hen nefer
in order to make something similar for himself for his horizon
as you repeat his feasts
vile kush is preparing to rebel
is what makes a moaner turn into an active opponent
content in the place of eternity
companion of the holiday
divine palace endowed with life
i have fetched you
it is the breach of a dike its waters pouring through
his terror is in khent hen nefer
an important one of the king of lower egypt
as it is good to listen to people
and the fields of khef her nebes
his father re is his protection
and he has come to plead with me about it
leader of the eastern lands
this means that he who twists speech from its correct sense
this humble servant seeks counsel from his god
excellent in speaking
having completed his years in happiness
who cannot be turned away
and the manifestation of this god was seen
it are the fishermen of elephantine who will dig out this canal every year
one will not do a thing in abydos
every day
the prince regent

the majesty of re said
i kept my city alive in its entirety
and who sleeps till dawn free from illness
four times
you will be praising this after years
every scribe
while his majesty was in thebes the victorious mistress of cities
with fresh myrrh trees
i did this again for
such has never happened to former kings
as he clasps his shield he strikes down
king of the black land ruler of the red land
keeper of all precious stones
and ignore death
i returned southward to egypt
to you belongs silver
given life forever until eternity
these three boats
the beauty of which i love to see
and recounted everything she had heard to ruddjedet
whom can i talk to today
then i made a capture and carried off a hand
for him who prays to see it come
but it does not make one tired
mistress of heaven weret hekau
the praise of me in the palace was greater than that of any sole companion
because of the difficulty of standing and sitting
and it happened that i placed myself on my belly
mooring post of the southeners
and their properties as well
look i am not the one who will bring it to you
the king of upper and lower egypt menkheperre
he said praised one
and a successful act took place against them caused by me
bull stout hearted as he enters the arena
the king of upper and lower egypt sehotepibre
because of the greatness of your might throughout the foreign land
then the high steward rensi son of meru said
so that he may be given life
to watch over these wild bulls
to heat them
my statues were placed in the temple in the following of the great god offerings having been established for them their offering bread having been fixed in writing
every man knows his regulations
i build it in the necropolis of abydos
i saw the digging of a lake
he achieves only failure
i let arrows pass by him
who does what is right is free from falsehood
acquaintance of the king and his cabinet
so that he may be given life
and those that were undecorated
then it is not biased
his heat scorches more than the flame of the torch
year 50 first month of the season of harvest day 22
copy my form do not neglect my words
a cut from the back of every bull
and the entire priesthood of the temple
i had set off for the mining region of the sovereign
but without letting a ship of the nubians pass
then meskhenet approach him
arriving safely by foreigners carrying all kinds of fine things
horus who rejoices in truth
my lord may you condone that a man calls upon you
then i brought away two female slaves as booty
and they couldnt go out for fear of the bull
who kept his name alive
my army hewed them in kush
turquoise and every kind of herb from the gods land were on their backs
count
horus mighty bull beloved of maat
the bedouin carrying their gifts
her mood was exceedingly bad
as you will pass to blessedness
a free for all
may she give every good and pure thing
he should stand on yonder side
sustenance
is it not wrong
city mayor
fenugreek
no eye had seen it
the king of upper and lower egypt menkheperre may he live forever
beating time for the troop
and he was given ten loaves of bread and two jars of beer every day
the beloved of the king will be blessed
breath of the mouth is beneficial to the blessed
one sinks low through greed
and is straying from what it is reminded of
he perpetuated the name of his cabinet
glorious seed of the almighty
by the signal giver
they advanced their hearts being bold
have you come to kiss this child
after i will have guided them by water and by land
i captured all their people
and to become the wife of the prince regent count
and fashioned the cabin
but who has become a pattern for the criminal
a method that has been successful
and find him
she who will make
who are experienced in what they know
bearing royal gifts
there can be no opportunity for riches for an evil man
only king raised by sopdu
it was reported to me
for your beautiful face which is lovely
you are given slaves of great strength and kind hearted slaves
then i said to her
he gave them to the house of his father amun
praise is given and the god is thanked
the princes of every foreign land came bowing in peace
at the head of his children
justified
given life forever until eternity
you are my servant
look she has gone saying
with me and the prince of bakhtan
and the prince of bakhtan organized a day of celebration for them
excellent confidant of his horus
then may you do evil
like the smell of myrrh
she went on to bestow on me another favour
when he is buried
then his majesty said to the crocodile
cooked meat roast fowl as well as desert game
he then said to them
something useful to whoever heeds
since it is wood that he likes
in your hereditary offices
and restrains me from death
lord of abydos
by sopdu neferbau semseru the eastern horus
gods wife of amun and great kings wife
and lebanon cedar
given life forever
brightly plumed
look justice is fleeing from you
since this land was founded
and he with whom one walked
he created the son of re tuthmosis ruler of thebes
bakhtan is your home
may your majesty send a learned man to see her
charged with tributes of millions of many things
i was parched and my throat was dry
look he is a god on earth
who devotes himself to the royal commission
he has made me lord of the five portions
the king of upper and lower egypt sehotepibre
on account of his divinity
and rub himself in
so did for him son of re amenophis may he live forever
i was sent by my lord l.p.h.
the son of ra
a greedy man is without achievement
i am the one who is speaking to you
a royal offering of amun lord of the thrones of the two lands
beloved of amun
the prince regent and count khnumhotep son of nehri
without coming out
and you are rich in every respect
the fear of him is throughout the land
and he reported what he had ordered to be done
he of edfu great god lord of heaven
who had flown from the lord of the two lands
before i have come to it
his attack having succeeded with valour and strength
in your everlasting tomb
at her going out into the daylight in order to see her house
enduring of monuments
hail to you re of the nine bows
now who can sleep till dawn
and the entire land is under his feet
divine state
as you will not be turned back at the difficult place
she is meaner than her daughter
none foolish whom you educated
the dance of the inert ones will be performed
high steward to the kings mother ahhotep may she live
and the great kings wife tiy may she live
beloved sole companion
ahmose may she live
and it ended up being twenty four cubits after its folding up
justified and revered
death is in my sight today
there were no deserters
then it is washed
refurbishing the offering stone
do not raise your voice peasant
let an offering be made of a thousand loaves of bread
a very strongly approving nod
meat offerings were established for them
vizier leader of all the officials of the judicial office
i shine for your sake
to receive this expedition of the king
at the 12 monthly feasts and the 12 mid monthly feasts
the lands of metjen trembling for fear of you
he says
who lived since the primeval time of the land
although i was not talked about
then his majesty said
of silver gold lapis lazuli black copper
my army hewed them in kush
we will not again do evil against menkheperre
the bedouin of asia in ivory and ebony
on the river from fresh cedar from lebanon
since he has sealed the entire land for me
and they said to his majesty
a single one of them put forth the strength of a thousand men
foremost in the house of his lord
by the might of the majesty of this god
as you do this your bodies will be well
beware of officials
he is eager when he sees the east
overseer of the granaries of amun
and they fled far away from me
and djedi said
of what he had planned to have said
left on a hill
and he will feel well immediately
concerning their opposing a briber
to the king of upper and lower egypt djoser justified
in order to reach for a life as you described
to learn what i might put in my mouth
and all the gods of the necropolis
then the prince of bakhtan let this god proceed to egypt
while being confidant of my lords
that was very narrow
i was one who was composed
he who is nothing
who took possession of his kingship of millions of years
according to the favour that came to pass in the presence of
the southern land to the palace l.p.h.
but discuss with the ignorant as with the wise
and they fled immediately
i countered their movements
what the land produces
are you not a man
years were made to vanish from my body
until they came out
his majesty returned every time
i championed wenennefer
the one whose house is empty his foundation wavers
and you will let him put ointment on himself
it is his power that fights for him
one will find its trustworthiness
i shall recount your might to the sovereign
the eyes are to be rubbed in with it
in his ignorance
only on account of his lord
and to your forefathers who are in the necropolis
people who mend a severed head
and upper valleys as if they were waterways
youths from west unet coming in peace
at the head of his entire army
then it is not biased
horus lord of the two lands is victorious
their cattle without limit
sovereign who restored egypt
the child departs the house when the lord is in the city
herald kares
the king of upper and lower egypt nebpehtire
its leash having fallen on the ground
to be eaten for one day
and kings who had been before
naval commander ahmose son of abana justified
fear not fear not young man
concerning his rank of leader of the city
i let the aggressors who come near you become weak
one sets the standard after you
in whose vicinity there is no resistance
look you are a hunter who slakes his desire
my mace overthrew the asiatics
free from wrongdoing
and very many soldiers and horses
to step into his official boat
i will go to heaven
horus lord of the two lands
excellent of plans effective of orders
for his father osiris
fish were there as well as fowl
the humble man who returns
in every place they reached
invocation offerings
the heart of thy majesty will be refreshed at seeing
then his majesty acted against it
so that you may lead the living forever
provide sustenance for this peasant himself
and took away all their food
his memory and his blessedness are for eternity
director of works at the rock tomb of the king
without informing his army
after he had brought together the borders of its two sides
in writing
or in these members of mine
and their properties as well
his majesty didnt halt
and he was brought to him immediately
as you will pass to blessedness
greatest of the companions
barriers from him arise against the one who disputes with him
overlord of the land to its limit
my majesty made you a companion
then he was brought before his majesty with his gifts
then this peasant proceeded to wail very loudly
those who built in granite
ignoramus look you are questioned
who sees all that he made he alone
as for a temple day it is the three hundred and sixtieth part of the year
childhood
laden with gifts for the king
he is more effective than a million of numerous soldiers
as you love life
my son re god who is greater than he who begot him
he said high steward my lord
to the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt nebka justified
making him go to bakhtan
to straighten out the land is to do justice
this god then went to the place where bentresh was
the great of heart is the gift of god
usermare sotpenre
wretched to be a suppliant
she loved me
khepri who tires himself with labour
i was one who listened when he heard the truth
perfecting everything that my lord had ordered
people along with cattle
of the first generation
on the ship the wild bull
then the prince of bakhtan had his gifts sent
two ladies living of birth
yet you have become a transgressor
and the fear of you wouldnt permit me to appeal to you
as you will not be hungry
a cure of a sick man
without him knowing
a thousand of all good and pure things
who exercises the kingship of his father osiris
1/4 end of xayt plant
and the goodness of what he does for it
if i answer it
first your son then his son then one of them
to be ground and mashed
while he enters the heart in front of people
be tender hearted so that you will learn justice
khons hat netjer neb
let me tell you something like it
all wood is splintered like a papyrus reed
and forget worries
since his face is blind to what he sees
horus of edfu great god lord of heaven may he give life
speaker of truth
with fat bulls and fat cows
everytime he takes aim
now
never descended something like it from this land
a child of this city
love of good comes into being
then the high steward rensi son of meru sent two guards
he is sakhmet to who defies his command
is he not to be rebuked
there is no cow that can be tied to the wall
making him go to bakhtan
who does for me all that my spirit desires
1 argun palm
then her neck was cut
the king of upper and lower egypt nebtawire
as your gods praise you
a mortuary offering
i was one who was exact in the palace
what is it you expend to satisfy your dependants
so that it will not be freezing
and he said high steward my lord
there was a man called khunanup
the poor man who spoke with his true heart was found
he is a brave bull
his majesty l.p.h. has hewn their barques
plumb line do not swing awry
good lord i report to you concerning the daughter of the prince of bakhtan
since the followers of horus
there was an old man
i was allowed to spend a day in araru
existing
he has filled the two lands with life force
lord of silence may you give me back my things
i shall return to the primordial water
a thousand men are tied against what is good for them
for he is your son he belongs to the shooting of your ka
o eldest god in whom i came into being
then i administered her a nasty blow
a very strongly approving nod of the head
in our lifetime
amun the great god
born of khyt
who illumines the two lands with his disk
to be unpacked in the festivity hall
to whose burial a survivor has attended
and the king in his time
to bring him his hearts desire
the black land and the red land were under his dominion
his majesty arriving to kill the enemies of the vile kush
a very strongly approving nod of the head
another thing is there
how lamentable is the poor man you ruin
and five arourae of land in my town
death is in my sight today
how good when a a son listens to his father
i went with him to his tribe
and two female slaves were given to me
with vine
but while i was your guide
your sailing is steadfast under your majesty
who smites the nomads of nubia
but your name still lives
thief robber snatcher
his majesty perceived the conspiring that was done against him by mankind
the king of upper and lower egypt lord of the two lands aakheperkare beloved of re
my majesty hunted them a herd of 120
who perpetuates the names of the ancestors
which bore his beauty
to be put in water
beware of doing evil
you will say as your utterance
and answer without stammering
it is sehotepibre who has gone to the horizon
this foreign land was made subject to his majesty
and barriers before the enemy
my heart lives for your sake
follow your heart as long as you live
who shuns evil
know your plumage and your property will last
the nine bows are gathered under his feet
about making provisions for the wife of this peasant
watch over your ka priests
dont disregard someone you know
and memory of me is in his palace
of 20 cubits from beautiful white limestone
as should be done
may he advance your position among the elders
because of the difficult stone on the ground
i rebuilt a colonnaded hall that i found in ruins
his placing him in the position of hereditary nobleman prince
my majesty commands that you be made to go south
o beloved of his city god
lady of the house baqet justified
ra speaks concerning that thing
the 3rd year
who is loved by his city god
while proceeding to the land of djahi
leader of all that is not and all that is
his father his mother together with all his sisters
the chamberlain intef born of senet
will you even find another peasant like me
went to the entrance of the portal
the king of upper and lower egypt maatkare
when the face is turned back to you after a storm
when you cross the sky
as i have seen an example of his learning
i didnt hear a reproach
ready of tongue
cakes
and your name is foremost among all living forever
incapable of communication
at every feast of the necropolis
live
gold horus being
you do as you wish
alabaster
the king of upper and lower egypt nebmaatre
all the gods who ordained this flight
the second time the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperkare bestowed on me another favour
will you then not allow us to pass on the path
while the captives were dragged in
but an evil act of someone without need
it is not known what brought me to this land
those who are subject to the lord of the two lands
in order to see the face of my lord
another remedy for curing
a royal offering of horus of hierakonpolis
prince ti
then she became still without rowing
horus mighty bull perfect of births
sehotepibre has gone to the horizon
i captured their inhabitants for egypt
his flame that drives away his enemies
seeing the monuments of their lords
silence is how you establish your superiority over him
he has given you every land
for i am burdened
that this good god performed
my years were in happiness
