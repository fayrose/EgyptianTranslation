until i reached the town of usu
i came to let you crush libya
beneficent seed of the god which came from him
this humble servant entrusts his chicks
here it is in my sight like heaven
the sun rises for your sake
a greedy man is without achievement
daily offerings will be made to me
then he came at me while i waited
made to restrain the bedouin
let us not go upon that difficult road
he said to me
this foreign land was made subject to his majesty
after i had cleared the path for the god
because he sees me carrying out your affairs
and the procession of upwawet
he is my son born to my majesty
in her town of djarukha
then the boat sank
to watch over these wild bulls
although i was not spat on
patient
then he said to them
and a wave with it of 8 cubits
are people ushered in to you
summon to me swift nimble messengers
a truly good god
staff are fetched when there is shortage
lord of abydos

with a golden rim
to be put in water
i will drink water at the watering place
son of re sesostris
and to the inheritance of the father of his mother
when the sky is hot
and the overseer of works hor say
fix the produce levy according to the grain harvest
because he sees me carrying out your affairs
it was as a dreaming state
like those of weary ones
he waits for a boat
so that we may hear it
then he bent his head down
who wont let an unemployed person through at once
why is this mentioned
great power residing in tawer
things are robbed by a criminal
the king of upper and lower egypt djeserkare
a little moment is like a dream
it has been prepared with every good thing

and let his sentence be executed
all controllers of phyles
and with male and female slaves as well
then i adorned it
through his excellent plans
i sanctified their chapels for the future
the one who obeys his body belongs to the enemy
ineni justified
son of re of his body
drinking water from the watering place of the river
and now we have come back safely
and live on their gifts
who is keen on destroying friendship
as for the mortuary priest or any person
as he who diminished them
so that they could not be reconstructed
as a man respects one whom his land knows
the king of upper and lower egypt nebmaatre
ssndm wood
beloved of month lord of thebes who lives in armant
copy of the reply to this decree

providing their sacrificial bread on earth
his majesty perceived the conspiring that was done against him by mankind
they arrived safely in thebes
i will not mention to you the youngest daughter
which had been in the hands of a companion
and united with the gods
the requisites for a mortuary offering will be recited for you
my majesty ordered the creation of the large bark on the river
everywhere
son of re
o ye who love life and hate death
the officials who were appointed to repel evil
and found that these fields were flooded
i set the dread of your majesty in their hearts
administrator of silver and gold
and the wood oil to those who are smeared with it
how sweet is the taste of this honey
hearing enters into the hearer
for the place from which he had brought him away
and of those aboard none remained
then one of the donkeys filled
in writing
look misfortune is on every side
my soul goes out
my name reeks through you
praised by all her gods
the one called an heir is the one who does favour
my provisions were from the storehouse of the palace every day
from fresh cedar from lebanon
the keeper of the diadem
their wine was found lying in their presses
dont disregard someone you know
create shelter so that your shore will be safe
this scribes hands are in the water but his feet are on the ground
his majesty came in joy
as if a marsh dweller saw himself in elephantine
then we sailed north
all protection for life with him
your arms are stronger than all lands
all sweetness
they are offered bread beer wine meat fruit
and weret hekau
`would that we might see him
who carries out a massacre of the bedouin tribes of asia
i will go to heaven
my majesty made you a companion
he says
the scribe ineni justified
prince turi
a pillar has fallen in the water

and that on which the sun shines
since i didnt intend to become involved in contention
i was assigned to the house of a kings son
this city listens when the lord speaks
i followed
they will not make your grave
whom can i talk to today
to widen the borders of egypt
then one acted according to everything that the majesty of this noble god had commanded
and the next morning i reached peten
the poor man who spoke with his true heart was found
you will not step on my clothes
a great lord takes what is without owner
made from a single copper plate
having taken possession of the two banks in triumph
sailing on the sea
he is the insight into what is in hearts
and the mother of my father
lord of rituals
from what you knew of him before
the servant loaded it for his lord when he commanded his doing it
and was kissing me in my clasp
then re said
and his majesty l.p.h. said to the royal wife in khnemsut
and all their weapons
it does not perish in this land forever
one who lives on defenceless birds
one came to tell his majesty
to ship these obelisks
then i became a soldier in his place
begotten by this humble servant in this place
then his majesty ordered to attack these wild bulls
born of the kings mother seniseneb
then they entered towards ruddjedet
with a mummy sheath of gold

the influence of a masculine pain demon the influence of a feminine pain demon
the memory of me among your children
male slave pamedjai
was at the counsel of your heart to you
o counts
going with her face towards the people before her
plated with gold
on the ship the wild bull
life to your nostrils
silence is how you establish your superiority over him
who constructed and completed beautiful pyramids
a man with an empty stomach is a man to complain
33/64 honey
to make a complaint to you
a thousand of offerings
your tongue is the pointer of the balance
joyfulness is what marks calm water
the season of growing
i was one who listened to what his superior had said
as khons the provider in thebes had commanded
so the son of meru must go astray
says
the recruits who have been trained by their lord
then this peasant proceeded to wail very loudly
sinuhe has returned as an asiatic
i let a troop of recruits come
so that he keeps speaking remain silent
with 120 sailors of the pick of egypt
i was clothed in fine linen
whom re chose
then she uttered a very great cry
the one whose house is empty his foundation wavers
and to your forefathers who are in the necropolis
she gave me her provisions
i restored their mortuary chapels
you live as long as the superior is pleased with you
to whom great ones come while they are bowing
justified and revered
while he enters the heart in front of people
who robs but from whom one cannot rob

and 317 women of her harem
now when his majesty arose as king
the excellent overseer of the peasants of the palace come

the total number thereof was 170 bulls
called pen nekhbet
the good god lord of the two lands aakheperkare given life
he gave them to friends of his
it is not in untruth before you
open the roads to the myrrh terraces
like a ship without a captain
that his majesty brought away from his victories
bailer of water look you are noticed
his memory and his blessedness are for eternity
it is a sore disease of the worm

son of re his beloved tuthmosis ruler of truth
another is in the house with the woman
who is great of strength in battle

she recruited its infantry
and let me be brought twenty nets
in order to placate them
the high steward rensi son of meru said
may he give a mortuary offering
that his majesty brought from this land
every day because of the greatness of the love of him
entry of the foreign lands
to cross that great river
mighty of arms
my mace overthrew the asiatics
their gates being closed because of it
of which a man says that is my father
upwawet of lower egypt
in festivity
then prince hordedef stood up to speak and said
praised by seshat
then she went to draw some water for herself
and its excess perishes on the ground
it is to be dried
this is the teaching of a man to speak to posterity
and the fear of you wouldnt permit me to appeal to you
his majesty appointed me scribe of the cadaster and his majesty showed me great favour
the heart of thy majesty will be refreshed at seeing
the gods were turning away from this land
and the governing of the two banks
six heqat of barley

every land against which i advanced
i am a well born man beyond reproach
after it had become dinner time
the hearer becomes one who is heard
arriving safely in the land of punt
then he laughed at me
a man speaks to another
of bread beer oxen fowl
while they bowed their heads to the ground
which is in a room under their seal
the man speaks in the house
then his majesty said
the overseer of the seal makers
then his majesty said
strong ruler who has destroyed the nubians
he filled their workhouses with male and female slaves
spell against pain
during the first expedition
within a house you may enter

royal seal keeper and sole companion
they stood on their walls giving praise to my majesty
the influence of a dead man
i let him proceed into the barque
the king of upper and lower egypt nebukaure
that this good god performed
where i was with my relatives

and my heart is laden with grief
death is in my sight today

in the vicinity of the pyramid
a herdsman of evil brings misery to his cattle

then she gave birth upon it
and strike the heads of the asiatics of retjenu
and his scalp of real lapis lazuli

she loved me
to see this beer
the bank is steep and the ways are under barley
khnum lord of kebehu in abydos

who sent my majesty to seize the lands and all foreigners together
and this peasant had him report back
his majesty stretched out his arm
and of the two pleasure ponds
in whose vicinity there is no resistance
then his majesty said
his majesty sailed on this canal
for the first doorway of the tomb

i brought away a chariot its horse
and now they brought them as gifts to my majesty
and who do not neglect what they were commanded
with the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt nebka justified

the majesty of re said to this goddess

i will take away thy ass peasant because it is eating my corn
the king of upper and lower egypt nebmaatre
theft suits those without belongings
i will go to petition on account of you to anubis
all of the possessions of the temple are in their proper places when the priest commanded its inspection
my name will endure because of my character
that you remain at your places
it is your spirit good god lord of the two lands
no equal to him exists among the brave of all lands together
ill go and tell this

now as for the water it was twelve cubits in its middle
united with the cavern of the one within everlasting time
for this statue of the count
natron
and he thrashed all his limbs with it
a servant of the royal harem
and amun lord of the thrones of the two lands
for inspection by the lord of the gods
in the milk of
the water of the river is drunk when you wish
gold horus who repeats birth
then two boats were made available to him together with their crew
he became rich in cattle
i reached the walls of the ruler
to create his statue for eternity
for i have grasped all that his eye revolves around
then a goose was brought to him and its head was cut off
those abominated by god
how happy is the gods land which you have entered like re
who proceeds according to his paces
he said he would fight with me
and who is not touched by the gruesomeness thereof
bend your back to your superior
for whom the lord of the gods sanctified the hebset festival
there is no cooling what is in his body
mistess of the two lands
whom he made great before his children
i answered this with the answer of a frightened man
i tied up the nubian nomads by tens of thousands and thousands
osiris nurse of the gods wife ahmose nofret iry
horus mighty bull beloved of maat
while the face of the helmsman is forward
son of re amenophis ruler of thebes
he who should reproach another is an evildoer
who saw the face of khenty
whom he hates will bear distress
because i was so excellent in his opinion
i have grown old and reached old age
whether i am at home or in this place
plated with electrum
and it was brought to him immediately
but provide sustenance for the wife of this peasant
the limits of art cannot be delivered
alabaster

a champion without equal

there is no profit in riches without them
and wrappings from the hands of tayet
his majesty sailed northward
good boats
ruler of egypt
i brought to them their offerings
bearing the beauty
he commits every error
which he planted on earth under the favour of this noble god amun
his opponants
together with two nubian nomads
while they brought many precious goods
then i went
one swears by him in all lands
guard against harming with words
the king of upper and lower egypt kheperkare may he live forever
worship the one who raises the double crown
may khons defend me a true scribe
be straight in character before your lord
he saw this god come out of his chapel
he was appointed as a royal scribe
no one knows what is coming when planning tomorrow
lord of the thrones of the two lands
he grabbed common folk
the barbarians flee before him
ahhotep
given life forever
forever
from the king
how can this be done for a servant
royal seal keeper and sole companion
now when some days had passed after this
whom can i talk to today
hunting in any foreign land
as things happen follow your heart
the good goddess maatkare who lives again
which it had hidden from other kings
bringing the best of the offering table
by means of the west winds
then the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt re came
and vigorous soles
and the fondness for me was before his companions
and i brought away a man as captive
after i will have entered the myrrh terraces
and it has reached the end of the earth
and the manifestation of this god was seen
thou art the father of the orphan
another remedy
and very early the next morning
merciless to the enemy who attacks him
may you not kick in her womb in this name of yours of sahure
prince regent and count khnumhotep son of nehri
except for the jars
how bad things are for me
they heard your battle cry and hid in holes
ploughing
they said
the count of the oasis
the fifth and sixth days of the month
how great is the might of amun
one steals
and fashioned its cordage
and deliver ruddjedet of the three children who are in her womb
to slay the rebels who were there
the woman who spoke about it
and who will pass this stela
live
they could foretell a gale before it came
may he live forever our lord
then his majesty took counsel with his heart
prince regent count acquaintance of the king
whose arrows cannot miss
then his majesty said
skins of golden jackals
as osiris loves you
this woman listens to the scribe
he is at peace to let one breathe air
i kept alive the names of my forefathers
let an offering be made of a thousand loaves of bread
my mind was vigilant seeking what would be useful
then he was brought before his majesty with his gifts
without answering anything he says
for obstructed are going by night travelling by day
but that fat of my body
he outdid what had been done since the time of the ancestors
and his majesty ordered him to go to bakhtan with this messenger
as my father praises me
oxen dragging you
love your wife within reckoning
thou shalt do nothing concerning it
gold horus justified
as for any people
as to him who will do what i say
i have become like a bull of cattle in the midst of other cows
then these gods proceeded
his majesty commanded the treasurer to direct works
i overthrew them as he ordered in the way that he used to do
loving myhrr
to the king of upper and lower egypt nebka justified
as i have seen an example of his learning
pigeons
an altar of gold and silver
more than the creeks of marshes they have fished
this humble servant will entrust his chicks
father of the god beloved of the god
as to all which is in writing on the papyrus-roll hear it
who was friendly and free of piggishness
joyous
i made for him a palanquin
unripe sycamore figs were there as well as ripe ones
who is praised by his lord is not insolent
upwawet of upper egypt
you will not be put in the skin of a ram
and gladdened the heart of this humble servant
sealed chest
one of the children
son of re his beloved ahmose
thus the god again became merciful
one who is truly close
that is exactly how that man is
who does everything that he praises
he achieves only failure
prince regent
he is bast she who protects the two lands
and this peasant came on the public path
the dance of the poor will be performed
whom can i talk to today
the shoulder is not injured by being exposed
mention my name
but as for any people
and put my backside on his chest
a man of truth before the two lands
then his majesty said to her
it is rich in all kinds of fine things
look you are a ferryman who ferries across anyone who has the fare
his beloved
justified and revered
it embroils fathers and mothers
meat offering of every bull
do not speak to him until he has requested
may your spirit contend with your enemy
and he reported to him what he ordered to be done
lord of the two lands
i let everyone tarry
if how you find it is
i lifted my heart and my body
it happened that his majesty sat in the audience hall
count
to the temples
and maintains the border of his begetter
you are taken away from leaping around
so that my name will endure
the child obeys the woman
and drinks a hundred jars of beer up to this day
three lions
sovereign l.p.h. my lord
this is the road of thoth to the house of maet
on the horus throne of the living
fell into the water
he who is nothing
at this block
an incense jar of gold
lord of the foreign lands chief of the troglodytes
it is the older princess who unites with the white crown
without limit of anything
and said
more accurate than a plummet
two ladies beautiful of laws who pacifies the two lands
there was nothing that was not on it
you will not founder when you land
a cure of a sick man
born of the kings mother imi
the divine council upon the flood
i gave praise to month
those enemies
he found him emerging from the door of his house
entrusted to me
my feet hastened
slacken your bow
good lord i report to you concerning the daughter of the prince of bakhtan
one of those days
i was uninjured without force applied to me
who established his two lands
in luxor
given life forever
son of re sesostris
then his majesty said
while maidservants grind barley for beer
given life
as the king is rejuvenating in your lives
behold i have written commending thee to the steward
took me to the place where he lived
of this temple of osiris
for the division of plots of land
thereupon his majesty kept sending to me with presents
do not pierce it with many glances
in this flesh of mine
slaughter is what spreads respect for him
who does what the souls of heliopolis praise
for the forefathers
he is the one great of magic
you will do this successfully
now ill speak again to you so hear people
the one who acts according to what is said is the one who loves hearing
when he is peaceful people breathe his air
since this land was founded
the victim loves to sate his heart
it was a beam that broke it for me
but i fabricated
the king departed from this life
its quantity without limit
good lord will you turn your face to khons the provider
the great double gate was shut
then his majesty appeared on a chariot
since im coming to sit in it
the hard man causes the end of his life
for none is born wise
his speech gains him indulgence
from the action of his heart and his tongue
fare well fare well young man
at every feast of the necropolis
born of ankhet
a troublemaker is a man with no mind
so you should take account of me
avoid the instant of sloth
magnifying his victories to let his valour be related
in abydos
kamose
the majesty of
as for a judge who ought to be punished
and was very frightened
then his majesty said
by knowledge by calming in speech
they came in peace safe and sound
at the head of his tribe
i took the crops away from them
served by the stars in heaven
son of re sesostris
heir who prospers by the favour of the sovereign our lord
similarly if one prayed to any goddess
and he has come to plead with me about it
his majesty entered upon that road
you are just like the balance
for her labour is difficult
and his eyes in seeing
they were more courageous than lions
never descended something like it from this land
and it ended up being twenty four cubits after its folding up
without a fault of his having been found by people
again i made a capture there and carried off a hand
it are the fishermen of elephantine who will dig out this canal every year
a man who worries all day long
when falsehood sets out it goes astray
he had concealed it
do not block the moment of a great man
i captured for him in the land of naharina
a hundred jars of beer
and adorn my chest with a collar
for the spirit of the owner of this tomb
vomit throw up
according to this state that i was in
and see what is done there
and fetter the bedouin as captives
ahmose called pen nekhbet
has become an enemy
which i couldnt count
and of the regentess greatly praised
to fight and conspire against my majesty
and to let them see your majesty as a crocodile
he is khnum for everybody
as you pass on your offices to your children
born of the lady of the house and lady of the court saat djehuti .]
semen of the bull of truth
and his scalp of real lapis lazuli
reared by divine isis mother of min
like radiance shines at noon
this is one who goes forth
im telling you what he did
when he came from naharina
and the falcon flew off with his followers
and returned the parts of water of the lake to their positions
after some days had passed after this
justified
the child departs the house when the lord is in the city
and made a burnt offering to the gods
after he had loaded his donkeys
who had come to its aid
look i shall take away your donkey peasant
to behold his fields and his cattle
a free for all
it is heartache
those who are on earth and those who will be
he intended to rob me
i will let your majesty hear a wonder that happened in the time of your forefather snofru justified
went to their wells
who finds the right words
then this peasant said
see me having reached land
given life forever
and i am near to passing away
i am your father
and anise
because he loved her more than anything
may you live like re
and this peasant said
to be accused of it each day
you are hapi who makes the meadows green
of ebony and pure ivory
who knew persuasion with flattery when it was spoken
a total of 15 boundary markers
shelter dont let the crocodile snatch
the influence of a god
which is in the house of aakheperkare justified
because he trusted me
oxen dragging you
at last he sits down
you speak to me
when you appeared
that he might celebrate millions of sed festivals
the evening offering
he loads his harvest into a boat
there is no misstatement therein
i touched the ground with my forehead between the sphinxes
when i came to her
then the wife of ubainer sent a message to the caretaker
then the pavilion was prepared with every good thing
to startle you
have you come to hurt him
given life
from beautiful white limestone
her head is covered with the kingship of the land
then the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt nebka justified said
may he give his favour to one who acts faithfully to him
send a message to him
leader free of greed
his majesty celebrated the feast of the opening of the lakes
i speak to you all people
in the temple
and to give goods to those who were loyal to him
my lord
of exceedingly great weight
relieve all distress on the water
now the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt kheperkare justified was told
grew wealthy in goods
the norm of speech is biased
carry out the mission for him as he says
her grave and her cenotaph are
courtiers were grieving
doing what their spirits like
words by amun lord of the thrones of the two lands
you do not perceive my heart
look you are a policeman who steals
to my majesty all their children
meals were brought to me
given life stability and dominion like re forever
have you come to kiss this child
greatly loved
are you unaware of my case
without expiration of the coming of the appropriate season
good god son of amun offspring of re harakhti
royal seal keeper
look the child is in the house with the woman
and will be buried
queen ahhotep may she live
when your grave is made
my son is a scribe
to straighten out the land is to do justice
crossing his western garden
and discrete about the affairs of the palace l.p.h.
high steward
much feared in the house of the kings mother
1 argun palm
and there may be rewards for you too before his ka
but why havent the jars been brought
he opens up the creation
and said
what matters more than my corpse being buried
who consorted with the ignorant
re has put the fear of you throughout the land
look you are strong and powerful your arm is strenuous
i did what men love and what the gods praise or i did what is loved of men and what is praised of the gods
to thank the god for him
one doesnt repulse his messenger throughout lebanon
from elephantine to the lagoons of the delta
as all subjects of my majesty
i brought a captive and presented him to his majesty
it gives no results in anything
he is beloved great of charm
and they pleased his heart
i carried off its inhabitants
the rebels against the lord of the two lands
its the girl who grew up in this house
one bracelet
without fault
you have grown old
noses are blocked when he falls to raging
sovereign my lord

when he erected a great gate of 20 cubits in front of the temple
magistrate who solves problems
to bring him back
charged with tributes of millions of many things

the hearer is one whom the god loves
as commander of his army
if you play the son of a man of a council
and have become a child of my majesty

then djedi said his magic spell
and cold as he wishes

and acquire property after lack of it
i grew up in the town of nekheb
