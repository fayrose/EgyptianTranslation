who was preparing a period of hostility
the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperkare
ready for battle in a narrow defile
be very welcome to me in peace sweet daughter who is in my heart
then the prince of bakhtan had his gifts sent
from the king
but the one mighty of strength overthrew them
to be ruler of his inheritance in menat khufu
and the land is left to evildoers
is without end
leader of the work on this statue
month lord of thebes
you are the steering oar of the land in its entirety
a lord of followers is great in respect
as when water flows
the hearer is one whom the god loves
to the north of mednit
those who are subject to the lord of the two lands
ready for battle in a narrow defile
until they came out
ramesse beloved of amun
then i called to the expedition that was on this boat
so says his singer
death is in my sight today
while they see their lord
to isis nephthys meskhenet heqet and khnum
his city loves him more than itself
your tongue is the pointer of the balance
justified
and the northerners come bowing to my might
it is commissioning something from a craftsman
the reach of a nurselings mouth for milk
with broad scope in what is commanded to you
but the truth returns to correct it
fright of my majesty to the southern boundary marker
and i cannot slay them until i have heard what you might say about it
or anything good that may be done with them
one steals
slacken your bow
from the crest of the world
the viziers house was nice
a castle of iron
and wearing of fillets
yours is what this horizon veils
and felled all their trees and all their fruit trees
i made for him a palanquin
like re forever
but if you flay him his thoughts turn to homelessness
and you are strong
the lord of life
dont become a flood against the suppliant
they stood on their walls giving praise to my majesty
to seek distraction for myself
and this nemtinakht said
that is his majesty spoke these words
for your beautiful face which is lovely
in the place of judgement
which was consecrated after its place had been established
their large chariots of gold and silver
lord of the thrones of the two lands
let me carry out his many expeditions
in their proper places
i acted as loving son of osiris
he saw the emergence of the darkness as the sun was setting
a total of 15 boundary markers
may you live like re
charitable
good lord will you turn your face to khons the provider
who will respect its statues
who had come to its aid
which his strong arm had attacked
you are the king who took possession of the two lands hatshepsut
great power residing in tawer
that you be remembered
or anything good that may be done with them
then they arrived at the house of reusre
o living who are on earth
learned woman
lord who eradicates falsehood
another remedy for curing
death is in my sight today
the tongue of people is their stand balance
after thy own old age
there can be no sleep for the lone man
o my comrade
of those who attacked him
and to let them see your majesty as avenger
ramesse beloved of amun
he is going out

then the high steward rensi son of meru sent two guards
there everyone sees and the multitude is pacified

ruler of the new settlements
his attack having succeeded with valour and strength
lord of ankh tawi
when he shoots at a copper target
may it descend as hathor
then isis said
as for him who is enriched by it
a distant place in fear
overseer of the granaries of amun
while his majesty l.p.h. had grown old
and recounted everything she had heard to ruddjedet
a haul of catfish
son of re mentuhotep
this is what they had come with
may he live forever our lord
and one did as everything that his majesty had ordered
he is sekhmet against the one who transgresses what he has ordered
the influence of a goddess
you will reach home and remain there
among your relatives
thus sachmet came into being concoction of the night
he created the son of re tuthmosis ruler of thebes
he created it as his monument for his father amun
given life forever
i am a king who speaks and acts
i didnt hear a reproach
another scribe hears this plan
and slept on a bed
a troop of warriors of unet arriving in peace
he turned away from this land through fear of you
my son is a scribe
may he fail what he came for
a protector who does not fear the rapacious
sole companion
the younger sister of queen nefrure
we were found on the road by a servant of our good lord who had been sent from the palace
he said it to him after sitting upon his great throne
for you have subjugated what the sun revolves around
so that i may have him report to you about it
my mace overthrew the asiatics
you show no mercy you are not troubled
i crossed a boat having been given to me
who robs but from whom one cannot rob
restoring what he found damaged
that is in this body of mine
in luxor
his majesty returned from kush having overthrown his enemies
o those who will pass by this stela
when the day dawned on which mankind would be slain
he created the son of re tuthmosis ruler of thebes
as you live for me
to whom is reported what is and what is not
and find him
the majesty of re said to this goddess
may you give me a sweet breeze
of someone whose eyes have the bjdj disease
and he restored what he found ruined
of bread beer libation wine incense and meat offering
and to let them see your majesty as an upper egyptian jackal
then my majesty erected my stela on that mountain of naharina
and he doesnt look at his belly
and a successful act took place against them caused by me
by the pronouncement that issued from the mouth of the majesty of
now i was in the van of our army
queen ahhotep may she live
and it will not happen due to him
and to let them see your majesty as your two brothers
everything that comes before my majesty through trade is his
his war cries are in lebanon
without your interment by foreigners
the fish spearer is harpooning awbbw fish
as commander of his army
which it had hidden from other kings
it is the life that comes of giving him adoration
deputy of the treasurer
then that enemy called tetian came
who destroys evil
a little moment is like a dream
and it was pleasure to my heart
see he hears
as the ruler may he live forever endures
while the king is in the stateroom
prince regent and count
then it is ground

he became rich in cattle
and a wave with it of 8 cubits
that i might answer what he had said

leader of the administration of the lord of the two lands
his purification was done
now there was a ruler in the north of vile kush

as a sender in whom are divine limbs
and fowl
death is in my sight today
shining of form in his youth
and his majesty said to the royal wife
give us your breath our lord
as you will not be hungry
the arbitrator is a cheat
and you even deprive me of the lament from my mouth
he loads his harvest into a boat
with my arms
because the great god has ordained
queen and sister of the sovereign l.p.h.
i did what men love and what the gods praise or i did what is loved of men and what is praised of the gods
son of re of his body
the great double gate was shut
this nemtinakht then said to a servant of his
for inspection by the lord of the gods
about whom is said he belongs to his rival
and none looked back
its banks were planted with all kinds of sweet trees
and was endowed with his people
with strength and might that i created for you
then his majesty said

to one to whom destruction had been ordained .]
it is pleasant that the gods should eliminate the concealment of my body
confident that you will do everything

i overthrew them as he ordered in the way that he used to do
then the prince of bakhtan went on to report to his majesty saying
it is the good god

but it isnt known
my name reeks through you
but can be found with the women at the grindstone

how firm you are in your eternal place
i brought his majesty to egypt from upper well in two days
he is the one who restrains every thief in this entire land
for youll hear the language of egypt
the influence of a dead woman
and they washed him after his umbilical cord had been cut
which sheds its flame in fire and emits its fragrance
because it is more beneficial to him who does it than to him for whom it is done
but shy fish will come to you
in joy by the expedition of the lord of the two lands
before the people
gold horus great of strength who smites the asiatics
he should stand on yonder side

i was a speaker in the hall of justice
the prince regent
but it is found with handmaidens at their mill-stones

of exceedingly great weight
death is in my sight today

i reached old age in my town

my name reeks through you
when he found him

and had come wise from the womb
mankind then conspired against him
with his heart in accord with mine
before his circumcision
i will drink water at the watering place

the utterance of a man saves him
horus mighty bull beloved of maat
with many tributes of gold and silver
through his excellent plans

but do not respond as one who questions a humble man
horus mighty bull beloved of maat
it was his majesty who opened its road
oxen
gods wife great kings wife
i have been rewarded with gold seven times
he grabbed common folk
he nourishes who is loyal to him
to be ground and mashed
as something to good effect before your workers
and a successful act took place against them caused by me
then i went down to the shore near this boat
he travelled north on it his heart being glad having slain his enemies
giving him his arm
like a mans longing to see home
son of re tuthmosis
my lord i have found one of these peasants who is truly eloquent
my heart led me to serve the king
behold i am before thee
a lion is not sent on a mission
at every feast of the necropolis
but she did not turn back
none downcast whom you enlivened
then this peasant spent a period of 10 days
existing
hunting in any foreign land
my majesty subjugated every land
while he rushes between the barbarians as a star that crosses the sky
at every seasonal festival
the ship deviates as it pleases
they all went on donkeys
he erected the upper egyptian boundary marker for me
living again
ill go and betray
so i have now plied my sounding rod
in the middle of the night
leader of the city and grand vizier kay
son of re ahmose given life
there is indeed no boasting therein
what the ocean surrounds being enfolded in your grasp
you attained them
he ruled his city when he was an infant
death is in my sight today
making for him a resting place of eternity
in year 23 second month of the season of growing day 19
his name was nemtinakht
who tramples all rebellious foreign lands
the influence of a masculine pain demon
great one free of arrogance
count
so that she might achieve given life stability dominion
when he came from naharina

the good god
look the boat is on the ground
loving myhrr
so you should take account of me
let me be brought twenty oars of ebony plated with gold
12 vines
galena
gold horus who wears the crown who placates the gods
and forget worries
as the king of upper and lower egypt usermare sotpenre has commanded
son of re tao
he who should rest is making people pant
to bring him back
i was free of pilfering from the property of the god
and its cargo perishes on the ground
with effective speech
you were appointed to hear cases
o wisest of all mankind
what will be done for you is good
and as your children thrive for you
but who is there is a wise man
never was anything like that brought to any king
and the brother with whom one dealt
from the provinces of lower egypt
then the kings children were ushered in
to expel the influence of a god
one great of strength like the son of nut
their gods will not receive their white bread
male slave djehutisenebu
year 22 second month of the season of growing day 10
her grave and her cenotaph are
his majesty put a great seal on me of pure amethyst
watching over
i found his majesty on the great throne in the gateway of electrum
to the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt cheops
but he cant hear her
and she said
i departed from byblos
dont speak falsehood
that is at the sacred mountain
deprived of the profit of speech
all taste has gone
to the place where i came into being
and was in the favour from their majesties
fashioning their statues of real electrum
another remedy
the enemy failed
my eldest son nekhet born of kheti was appointed
what you wish will be done
what will happen is what your spirit desires
when the town of avaris was besieged
this scribes hands are in the water but his feet are on the ground
he entrusted to her the heritage of the two lands
this boat is large
of the finest of his tribe
royal seal keeper
their chiefs bowing their heads
because he loved him so much
to the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt
judge of nobility and subjects
the two lands were under her direction
with the entire royal household l.p.h.
it devours the aegean islanders with its flame
who possesses bread should be merciful
skins of golden jackals
i have learned of a commoner who lives in djed snofru
i was one who was kind in the offices
then djedi said his magic spell
the nine bows are gathered under his feet
the numerous army of metjen was overthrown within an hour
she has no antagonists among the northerners
then you will say
restoring what he found damaged
the like had not happened before
troops being with you
your monuments are greater than those of any king who has been
all protection life stability dominion and health with him
the priests who-are-in their times
i do not weep for that mother
overseer of works in your very shrine
and the great kings wife tiy may she live
or with a message
one was well disposed towards me in all respects
i found it was a serpent which was coming
who tires himself greatly
has become an enemy
plumb line that carries the weight
every criminal will say
true and beloved acquaintance of the king follower sinuhe says
and was now returning having carried off captives from libya
but it is the act of a god
until it becomes dead matter
and his majesty said
i have provided his protection against you
who was eloquent in anxious situations
give him praise like re
and khons the provider in thebes went
served by the stars in heaven
and the prince of bakhtan organized a day of celebration for them
sealed chest
beloved of the ennead of karnak
her majesty praised me
sem priest with clean fingers
and all monuments that his majesty built for him
be careful that you do not run aground while at the tiller
may your majesty command to spend a day of celebration
these 100 loaves
hasty to succeed
destroyer dont let people perish
he executed a royal commission
be commanding with people collect your staff together
with my arms
it was nice
given life like re forever and ever
may you not be powerful in her womb in this name of yours of userref
after the seven days had passed
hearer you do not really hear
you have erected my sanctuary as a work of eternity
what my soul said to me
and you are rich in every respect
the one who acts according to what is said is the one who loves hearing
forever and ever
and you will make another soul who is hungry envious
to what will happen
a royal offering
ointment is the remedy for her body
as what the arms of the good god did
another herd
and his beloved wife iy justified
son of re sesostris
i renovated this tomb of the kings daughter
the gods wife bestowed on me another favour the great kings wife
tuthmosis may he live forever
all health all joy
once it happens that you have left this place
before the entire land
to take them away is to stop up his nose
of gods and people
at new years day the opening of the year
then khons in thebes neferhotep proceeded to khons the provider
i restored their mortuary chapels
in writing
lord of the thrones of the two lands
prince regent and count
like the smell of myrrh
with sailors whom you know
sustenance is the king abundance is his word
joyfulness is what marks calm water
and the northerners in accordance with his guidance
it will be supper
menkheperre may he live eternally is the one who opens the way as something perfect
on the first occasion
your lips
to make his complaint
and my name was not heard from the mouth of a herald
i went down into the water
incapable of communication
fare well fare well young man
the younger sister of queen nefrure
no wave will carry you off
beholding collection of cattle tax by prince regent and count
with 120 sailors of the pick of egypt
together with an expedition of ten thousand men
he placed me at the head of his tribe
i placed myself between two bushes
then his majesty said
one prisoner
a great lord takes what is without owner
his children do not find his residue
may i be allowed to inform you
and he said saluting his majesty
than that my servant might seize you
and ignore death
if you see someone suffering from mucus
in the necropolis
the shares of horus and seth are under his supervision
guard against a man of experience saying
day 27
my years were in happiness
an heir who will make offerings
none is content there
for whom there is no escape from the west
did you descend on the road of heaven
then the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt nebka justified had the wife of ubainer taken away
to be put on the eye lids
be careful that you do not run aground while at the tiller
through you every eye sees
and excellent scribe from among you
etc
but who is there stands in a barque
the bedouin of asia in ivory and ebony
and he had a wife called meret
to make its voyage therein
his majesty came in joy
in teaching the ignorant to be wise
while his majesty was in thebes
that organ in a man is his canker worm
hunting in any foreign land
when you cross the sky
the fish of the waterside speak to them
withdraw the flood so as to do justice
to the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt nebka justified
and your environment is corrupt
know your plumage and your property will last
a thousand of bread
before his majesty
officials are giving to you
and his friends gave them to him
then he was brought before his majesty with his gifts
for millions of years to come
though no brother of his can be fetched to side against you
there is no exaggeration
with a target of hammered copper
then his majesty sent a numerous army to taseti
who knows the morning before it has come
and you will catch fatted fowl
and maintains the border of his begetter
which were desirable to his heart
he gave to her what the sun revolves around and what geb and nut surround
may i follow the mistress of all
keeper of the diadem
the servant loaded it for his lord when he commanded his doing it
because he sees me carrying out your affairs
which is something that the chief lector priest ubainer did
to learn what i might put in my mouth
king of the black land ruler of the red land
that is in this flesh of mine
and the misery from them has been pacified
my army hewed them in kush
who follows his lord in his strides
concerning every office that he held
incense was put on the fire
as khons the provider in thebes had commanded
true favourite of his lord
i opened my mouth to my soul
and his majesty l.p.h. said to those in his retinue
so that they may give their excellent counsel
look you are strong and powerful your arm is strenuous
lord of abydos
i raised the orphan without a father
they would be too numerous to put into writing
if one prayed to a god to ask a thing of him
pieces of wood from farafra
who lets the god know his sanctuary
who didnt arrest a man for an utterance
whom re chose
if you are brave be stout hearted
then the prince of bakhtan had his gifts sent
i halted at the road of horus
i came to let you crush the eastern land
has pain in his head
i was a speaker in the hall of justice
so that it will not be freezing
you will not founder when you land
and your stomach is full
welcome in peace
and it is not difficult for the mouth of him who says this
to wade in their blood as far as herakleopolis
goldsmiths seal keepers of the palace
and he with whom one walked
favour ahead of the ancestors
so take care that he doesnt drown
a balance that is crooked the pointer of a balance that errs
maa wood like alabaster for supply to the residence
then i brought two warriors as captives from the ship of aata
a very strongly approving nod of the head
the hill dwellers
by him in whose body the pains are
my serpent diadem on your head consumes them
of atum lord of the two lands and heliopolis
he was dedicated since he was born
forever and ever
and upper valleys as if they were waterways
justified
but who is there is a wise man
when the pubic area is painful
give breath to him who is suffocating
existing
who placed every land under her feet
since he has sealed the entire land for me
i was one who was liked in the house of his lord
my majesty did this for my father osiris
and he said saluting his majesty
ahhotep
i captured for him in kush
your tongue is the pointer of the balance
there came a strong man to retjenu
its head likewise
which were destroyed by fire forever
there follows peace before his ka
and fasten on the agency of those who do
and passed biga
while you turn them into corpses throughout their valley
crossing his western garden
leader of the administration of the lord of the two lands
the spirit of the correct man is the spirit that brings happiness
and i cannot slay them until i have heard what you might say about it
you are here and you will stay with me
how good it is
without informing his army of it
three hands
khnum lord of her wer in abydos
before the people
and most august than they who created him
o living who are on earth
the prince of bakhtan stood by with his army
as you will not be turned back at the difficult place
his house was his fathers house when he was still a child
an evil deed cannot reach harbour
then it will be brought to us
the season of growing
and customs houses were established on the river
next to the deeds of bravery
while the kingship of the two lands
that he might present his issue before the father of the eldest
who races
look the child is in the house with the woman
while the cobra is placed on your forehead
to be mixed
from the stories of the ancestors
the two lands
to herakleopolis in order to plead
i was greeted with health and life
than what the entire army achieved
from elephantine to the lagoons of the delta
i have given you all life and dominion from me all stability from me
to herakleopolis in order to plead
in the favour of your city gods
then prince hordedef said
and mankind and gods were still united
on the day of the massacre by the good god
then his majesty said
his majesty spent a day of celebration
and fish for me
and goodness is cast on the ground
i am one who was good
every day because of the greatness of the love of him
with my movements
and fetter the bedouin as captives
by a man who is my peer
it was finer than anything
he has filled the two lands with the trees of life
he knows the number of chambers of the sanctuary of thoth
horus mighty bull appearing in thebes
and djedi said
so good is the kindness
like going outside
and its royal funerary chapel
and to let them see your majesty as an upper egyptian jackal
it was his majesty who opened its road
on his border with another land
and this peasant said
i will not speak
there is no eye that is more able than she to smite them for you
with mucus in his neck
beating time for the troop
they are the flock that is good for their lord
great in his rank
sehotepibre has gone to the horizon
i have ordained it to you long ago
heir of horus in his two lands
i am free of fate
who was ruler of upper retjenu
whom this army of his majesty had brought
every feast of the happy living and of the dead
this god arrived in bakhtan at the end of one year and five months
there is a commoner called djedi
who developed his beauty in the body of niut
and with my excellent plans
his majesty himself hunted ...] elephants in the land of naharina
the king of upper and lower egypt lord of the two lands
the hard man causes the end of his life
no losses occurred to the evil ones
until they came out
i let him proceed into the barque
i captured for him in the land of naharina
1/4 end of xayt plant
then these gods were brought
to make a complaint to you
meat offering of every bull
you have come to us to be merciful to us
in that land of naharina
his southern boundary reaches to karoy
embellished with ebony
if you wont do it she wont do it
or with a message
a cure of a sick man
for the count and excellent scribe of the good god
djedi then said
it will completely turn into worms
i was one who listened when he heard the truth
there is nothing for contents here
may he live forever
does the hand balance err
we have reached home
he is one who creates in his being
the princes of retjenu dragged these flag poles
as for every lector priest and every scribe
as what the arms of the good god did
there is no cooling what is in his body
every lector priest
my heart is glad
for nine days
to travel south therein
then he said to me
beating time for the troop
not a soldier retreated
and this peasant came to plead with him for a seventh time
for you have been brought up as a pupil of my majesty
inflict punishment on him who ought to be punished
who can be ferried across
then one of the donkeys filled
like re in heaven
slaughter is what spreads respect for him
son of re his beloved tuthmosis ruler of truth
achievements of count khnumhotep
and re said
everything that comes before my majesty through trade is his
and with male and female slaves as well
under the majesty of
all things were entrusted to me under the king of upper and lower egypt
coming and going are by his command
he was appointed as a royal scribe
lord of the thrones of the two lands
wereret mistress of punt nut
your yards will not break
does not every plan succeed by it
cast evil on the ground
gods lords of egypt
it is his sister
of bread beer oxen and fowl
and no holiday for the greedy
who placed every land under her feet
i have found a peasant whose property has been stolen
listen to me
as i live as re loves me
a ship could not sail on it .]
a chariot wrought in gold
1/8 wheat
this is the precept
my brother
as the foremost of those in the west praises you
to bring him his hearts desire
year 2 second month of the season of inundation day 15
the heart is the creator of its master
as found in writing
they come bearing tributes on their backs
if you are a man of entry
trample on evil
he captured a herd of twelve wild bulls
truly exact like thoth
correct like a balance
the commoner came out as was his daily custom
in your everlasting tomb
and to give goods to those who were loyal to him
in adorning the god
i kept my whole town alive
who will pass by this monument
may his majesty l.p.h. do as he wishes
etc
and gave me
and there was fighting on the water in padjedku of avaris
gold horus justified
they give praise to the lord of the gods amun re
my majesty attacked them
i equipped the barque
after confinement
then one acted according to everything that the majesty of this noble god had commanded
may he advance your position among the elders
no advance can come of it
you will let the provisions be given to him
who have gone to others beside them
that is a resting place
son of amun re of his body his beloved
they went before my majesty
may my soul not depart
the temples of the gods and goddesses
i will create a breeze
the road on which it travelled was exceedingly difficult
you advance one who does it on earth
for doing is more useful to the doer than to the one for whom it is done
for mercy has left you
khnumhotep son of neheri justified
summon to me my eye and shu tefnut geb nut
he is the sun by whose rays people see
my ladies what can i do for you
like someone in his pyramid
tbsw shrubs
and this peasant said
landing in karnak
thereupon his majesty kept sending to me with presents
in fat of pintail duck
given life
and he said high steward my lord
to abydos in tawer
does not say i snare for my needs
his favourite place since the beginning
stand and sit at every step
the bedouin of asia are subject to my majesty
the child obeys the woman
he erected the upper egyptian boundary marker
every son of mine who shall strengthen this boundary
now as for the water it was twelve cubits in its middle
by the signal giver
in the temple
if you wish friendship to last
for whom the lord of the gods sanctified the hebset festival
unet is celebrating
when i found them as one heap of corpses
it is large
but as for any people
the man without speech running through his body
the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperenre
speak when he questions you
his bones were strong his limbs were destined to be of gold
to whom the authorities listen
the king is sustenance
great kings wife kings mother
and justice will be neither insufficient nor excessive
as for any son of mine
to prepare the road for it
for three children have been born to you
o living who are on earth
and his friends gave them to him
the king of upper and lower egypt lord of the two lands
explore the routes to punt
live in their houses
a thousand good things
then may you do evil
a pillar has fallen in the water
on a windy day
to his tomb south of peqer
you were built for festivity
it is not a burden on your shoulders
born of the kings mother imi
i created clay fields
do not pass by my form do not stray from my talent
if thou harkenest to this that i have said to thee every plan of thine will go forward
and know their waters according to what was in writing
who wont let an unemployed person through at once
what the land produces
harendotis
he is sekhmet against the one who transgresses what he has ordered
who created himself
i came to let you crush the boundaries of the world
sculpters drawers metalworkers
and the northern to the ends of asia
the evening offering
the servant loaded it for his lord when he commanded his doing it
the pick of negau
what do you achieve
but desire to reach the west
here she is
for i am laden with sorrow
when your body is buried
let an offering be made of a thousand loaves of bread
i am his favorite servant
he caused protrusion of three palms behind it
and 317 women of her harem
without confusing one with another
from a net of cord
then i stretched my legs
and this nemtinakht said
my name will endure because of my character
the influence of a dead man
and now they brought them as gifts to my majesty
and everything good from the southern land
this peasant said to this wife of his
arriving safely by foreigners carrying all kinds of fine things
ushering me
standing on their chariots
offspring of the bull of the ennead
son of re sesostris
their hearts are in joy
he loved the dog more than his daughter
who says what is good
the king of upper and lower egypt lord of the two lands
it is sehotepibre who has gone to the horizon
who will pass this stela of mine
when it was reported to the royal herald
he appointed me as kings son
then the prince of bakhtan went on to report to his majesty saying
beseeching my majesty saying
and what one city had taken from another
and found her eldest uncle on her mothers side
my heart lives for your sake
restoring their boundary markers like heaven
as the sun sets and rises
all health and all valour and strength
tnm plants
lords of goodness
the high steward rensi son of meru said
it is parrying a thing before shooting
narw birds
amenhotep god and ruler of thebes
he is beloved great of charm
his majesty ordered the creation of a lake
i repel the evil from them
both upper and lower egypt
people who mend a severed head
theft suits those without belongings
i followed the king of my time
i was clothed and my hair was combed
and stand at the tomb shaft on the day of burial
nor is there casting of falsehood on the ground
doing justice is breath for the nose
i was given gold of valour
so as to set your heart at rest about what you came for
forever without end
i spoke in truth
anyone who say i can be powerful
that was very narrow
youths from east unet
two necklaces of gold
and the northerners in accordance with his guidance
the king of upper and lower egypt khakaure
i shall return to the primordial water
born of the kings mother imi
i will be guardian of his health
and this peasant came to plead with him for a fifth time
who brought you
restoring their boundary markers like heaven
its that i was going
look you are a town without a mayor
to be put in water
the divine council upon the flood
at landing
one lives on the breath that you give
attractive to the heart
about your beautiful arrival at my temple
on this stela of mine
divine state
on this day one is in the good palace
bringing the best of the offering table
at the lake of niya
should be shelters from the agressor
as to that burial
to straighten out the land is to do justice
as it came from the works
given life
son of re of his body
six heqat of barley
by amun lord of the throne of the two lands
there was an old man
second month of the season of inundation day 23
steward
that i built a tomb
the place where he is
while you shine before them in my likeness
you satisfy my heart at every moment
102 fierce lions
and the misery from them has been pacified
royal confidant amenemhet
who will see what is in it
one cannot know what is in the heart
and his majesty gave them to me for slaves
patient
i did justice sharper than a needle
of the rule of the father of my mother
yet there is none hasty of speech who is free of spluttering
the name of the prophet and priest
whose lord has entered his reflections
the sight was exceedingly beautiful
then i died for them
the hard man causes the end of his life
i did everything that his majesty had ordered
magistrate at the head of the people
his appearance as chief of the two lands
their gifts of gold silver lapis lazuli
i gave praise on the shore to the lord of this island
count
at this border that my majesty established
did you descend on the road of heaven
1/4 dates
the scribe listens
revered in his district
of fresh myrrh trees
initiated of amun re
my majesty turned them into ruins
for the king knew his eloquence
and tows the transport
i reached the walls of the ruler
whom he raised over his nobles
the pick of the gods land
in writing
my father built for himself a mortuary chapel in mer neferet
their wine was found lying in their presses
glorious seed of the almighty
do not take up your heart against him
and one turns to a stranger
how sweet is the taste of this honey
bearing royal gifts
then i adorned it
mortuary priests were given to me
and then your majesty yourself will plant them
nephthys behind her and heqet was hastening the birth
its leash having fallen on the ground
the procession of sem priests
slacken your bow
when i came to her
to slay the rebels who were there
and found these elephants there
act for him who acts to make him act
two ladies who repeats birth
he opens up the creation
there is no profit in riches without them
and argues
who pondered it in the heart
the dance of the inert ones will be performed
then this peasant came
the man speaks in the house
the glance of man had not fallen upon it
these gods then went out
the servant of this wab priest bathes herself in the pool with all his daughters
my soul is ignorant about easing the misery that is due to life
the prince regent
its western side to input
his eye had not yet been afflicted
and khnum made his body healthy
high steward my lord great one lord of the great
praise the king within your bodies
and the high steward rensi son of meru sent two guards to fetch nemtinakht
a fraction of the object of greed
now as for him who shall lose it and shall not fight on behalf of it
that grow in punt
and this goddess said
following his word
his majesty did all sorts of fine things for me because he had known me as an overseer of construction projects who is better than all the overseers of construction projects in this land
a mortal man dies along with his underlings
33/64 honey
to be repeated by putting it
heaven and all foreign lands created by the god are completely subservient to her
not everything for which he petitions can come to be
so those who hear it say
according to the favour that came to pass in the presence of
he who measures heaps of corn is pilfering for himself
he grasped mankind
he appointed me as chief of construction in order that i might build great monuments for him
who knew persuasion with flattery when it was spoken
his eyes
filled with water to its edge
may he live like re forever
a very strongly approving nod of the head
i returned southward my heart being glad
which bore his beauty
you say
now the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt kheperkare justified was told
female slave hadetkush
she gave me all her property in edfu
uproar in the northern sky
setting off on a good journey to the gods land
you can find it to be so for eternity
savior of the poor
my name reeks through you
in his old age he achieves revered status
then as the prince of bakhtan was asleep on his bed
and one did as everything that his majesty had ordered
you will delay him here
after i had followed the god to his house
then they presented him with their menits and sistra
look you will arrange the matter with me
like the skys clearing
so that you may be persistent at it
taken in a stranglehold
given life stability and dominion like re forever
his majesty appeared on the throne of his father
he makes the seasons with the months
tuthmosis beautiful of form
while he is bad mouthing
a very strongly approving nod
my mind became weak
to be ground and mashed
you will not step on my clothes
he perpetuated the name of his cabinet
there will be no poor man alive
that he might be alive
ships were manned and laden with riches
he shall not be and his son shall not be in his place
and the council of the residence
i am like your hounds
who is remembered for his successful deeds
this is their law for their desire
the victim loves to sate his heart
let us not go upon that difficult road
when it wasnt known yet
consisting of every excelling deed of bravery since the beginning
and you will join the companions
in the evening
in the lands of fenkhu
common soldiers
the light of the uraeus is your protection
i will heap up hay
beam of heaven
two ladies beautiful of laws who pacifies the two lands
whom can i talk to today
may it descend as hathor
he reached his home in order that he could be with his brothers
no wrongdoing by me was found
it is a field of benefit for its lord
whereupon djedi said
landing in karnak
my waters do not know the great favour from the king
the norm of speech is biased
again i made a capture there and carried off a hand
a great lord takes what is without owner
we live as men who have by their labour
chief of the two lands
they would be too numerous to put into writing
i will also give offerings precious goods
each man controlling his tribe
but if it expels itself
to to weigh it on my behalf
as should be done
the arbitrator is a cheat
a royal offering of amun lord of the thrones of the two lands
i am your father
he proceeded to the district of peqer
come with them to the palace
confidant of the king in the southern lands
he is one who creates in his being
what was done for me will likewise be done for you
i shall make him aware of your greatness
founded upon the praise of his perfection
to see the sun
three lions
may thoth declare concerning me the gods are satisfied
and they went up in flames because of it
that comes from the offering table of the lord of all
one with powerful arm the like of whom has never been
the king of upper and lower egypt lord of the two lands
beat him with the hostility of the officials
may thoth declare concerning me the gods are satisfied
your arms are stronger than all lands

then this spirit who was with her said to khons the provider in thebes
in the temples of upper egypt
does the hand balance err
its water its fields its tamarisks and its sand
gold horus who placates the gods
your rewards in their place
i added to what was bequeathed to me
you are just like the balance
confident that you will do everything
my provisions were from the storehouse of the palace every day
and found that he knew it
who moulds his moulder who creates his creator
and i will not repeat speaking
laden with all wealth of egypt
richest of the rich
and trampled the towns on its banks
this god arrived in bakhtan at the end of one year and five months
he was a falcon of gold and flew to the sky toward egypt
for you block our path with your clothes
khnumhotep son of khnumhotep son of nehri
let the pavilion that is in the garden be prepared
joined and united by the word of your majesty
in order to see the face of my lord
on the day of measuring provisions
in the evening
it is more than exaggeration
of baboons vervet monkeys and greyhounds
and forget worries
so that they may give their excellent counsel
and the majesty of this god said
as upwawet loves you
and drunk with your beer
those who push forward are not made
lord of the thrones of the two lands
none speechless whose mouth you opened
he achieves only failure
how bad things are for me
his majesty offered an example thereof in the temple of amun
the one who had ordered this victory
look i am under way without a ship
but without letting a ship of the nubians pass
may he live forever
a man on the rise
but it does not make one tired
you have returned
truly risen is the lord of abydos
of hides of upper egyptian panthers
they bring good produce
and very many soldiers and horses
like a ship without a captain
then the royal scribe thothemheb came before his majesty
son of re tao may he live forever
their gates being closed because of it
only mouth that silences the mouths
at the table place of one greater than you
if you would call burial to mind
more than sitting on sandbanks of crocodiles
1/4 cooked earth almonds
and five arourae of land in my town
in luxor
she took care of its refugees
by the might of the majesty of this god
everywhere
for look your harbour is surrounded by crocodiles
because he sees me carrying out your affairs
there was nothing that was not on it
he is seen by everyone
and he with whom one walked
this is the norm of the divine word
and this peasant came to plead with him for an eighth time
since your eye is on those who scheme against you
while restoring the northern like heaven
with handles of sqb wood plated with electrum
as a favour of the sovereign
of osiris
the heart is weary
will wish a bier
your splendour is like the splendour of heaven
and of labourers and their children
may they take as much myrrh as they wish
this ruler amunenshi
as the monuments of your city gods will last for you
together with two nubian nomads
i was one who knew for him who knew not
men and women pass by cheering him
because he sees me carrying out his affairs
and the fields were flooded three palms high with the liquid
and as director of works in karnak
the majesty of this god then said
his intimate friend
sole companion
seqenenre justified
he is the insight into what is in hearts
my lord may you condone that a man calls upon you
as the king is rejuvenating in your lives
given life forever
and the brother with whom one dealt
noise in the southern sky
his terror is in khent hen nefer
do not take up your heart against him
there can be no heir for the mean spirited
a summary of the deeds of valour and strength
there came a strong man of retjenu
bailer of water look you are noticed
and this peasant came
as for any man who will put his hand
the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperenre
shelter dont let the crocodile snatch
the influence of a goddess
ascended to heaven and united with the sun
to perpetuate the shrines of the gods
with its leash on the ground
to wade in their blood as far as herakleopolis
and something harmful to whoever transgresses it
royal seal keeper and sole companion
tuthmosis
their tongues were not partial
and may your verdict be accounced
finding him by his majesty
that there is no one who could do it but you
after some days had passed after this
their arms are raised in adoration
to bring me a precious block
what he loves is action for him
he says
and she recounted this matter to him
yet officials should be people who dispel injustice
his wife says to him
from the best of the foreign lands
one is contented with evil
then she became still without rowing
i will take away thy ass peasant because it is eating my corn
who guides my majesty on the good road
such is osiris
one to whom the listeners listen
who did good to his equal
their courage rose
menkheperre may he live eternally is the one who opens the way as something perfect
then his majesty proclaimed concerning these wild bulls in their entirety
10 cubits by 10 cubits on its every side
his majesty l.p.h. has hewn their barques
the cultivator of wickedness is watering his garden with evil
before we had reached land
since a good state has come into being
do not stay silent if it makes you stumble
also beer
o my comrade
his beauty adorns amun re
its mouth with a wisp of barley
the man with power in a task turns about
surpassing what he was told before his lord
their gods bringing life and happiness
and excellent scribe from among you
it is rich in all kinds of fine things
select the fringes of action
there is a casket of flint in a room called the inventory in heliopolis
and excellent scribe from among you
he is a king who fights alone
daily you present yourself in the morning
alabaster
look you are a policeman who steals
i am not forsooth a confederate of his
has a heavy neck
the overseer of the seal makers painted
salt
overseer of the two silver houses
one who has nothing
people say what they see
the influence of a masculine pain demon the influence of a feminine pain demon
beloved of amun lord of the thrones of the two lands
hear do good things
so that he may be given life like re forever
took me to the place where he lived
with 120 sailors of the pick of egypt
herald kares
repeat a word after seeing
do not overwhelm the field labourer with work
if you take it away for filling its mouth with a wisp of barley
then he was brought
i gave you valour and strength against all foreign lands
since the god of those who had received the white crown
her hotep
then this peasant said you beat me you rob my goods
and he arrived in the district of per fefi
refurbishing the offering stone
and was appointed to be chief of upper egypt
and his belly is stiff because of it
your possessions are in your house
your sailing is steadfast under your majesty
it is rich in all kinds of fine things
then he said to me
who was eloquent in anxious situations
i returned southward my heart being glad
be seated
and for monuments
that the god may give me grace
my lord made me administrator of your monuments
at the approach of whose statues the people and the gods were rejoicing
give us life from you
who destroys evil
endures and prospers to this day
owner of a burial by the favour of the king
you will not be put in the wool of a ram
a son that listens
existing
and were thrown aside throughout their lands
i captured all their people
sailing on the sea
for nine days
and of the two pleasure ponds
how happy is he who can recount what he has experienced
what was ordered to me to be done there happened thoroughly
o tomb
from the sheer number of faults on him each day
given life stability and dominion like re forever
in order to placate them
the wind rose and rose again
about whom a lie has been told involving a man
and this peasant came on the public path
he will not be guilty
the man is in a state of joy upon seeing his fair daughter in his house
and one who should lead has gone astray
son of re his beloved tuthmosis ruler of truth
that i may live by his mercy
in distress
and was very frightened
the like had not happened before
who enters the turmoil of battle
to be ground
may he live forever
itnefer justified
2 jars of beer
wild mint
33/64 honey
who knows what is desired
i was honoured with the king
when the day dawned retjenu had come
hundreds of thousands of the finest of all foreign lands
then i placed myself on my belly
wealthy and great in every respect
cheating diminishes justice so render good account
craftsmen in creating what is
that id found obliterated upon the doorways
the king of upper and lower egypt kheperkare may he live forever
fight on his name
without my messenger being hindered
then he made a great offering
that we may live on the breath that he gives
primordial one
he fashioned ptah south of his wall lord of ankh tawi
who is praised by his god does not pilfer
o living who are on earth
then the maid went to get a cup of water for herself
with a mummy sheath of gold
do not rob but act against the robber
a loveable man
i brought a captive and presented him to his majesty
and he was placed on a couch of brick
relieve all distress on the water
goodness has been harmed there is no accumulation of it
it is the small minded that seize riches
who is among the gods
like those of weary ones
the king of upper and lower egypt lord of the two lands
of gold four rings
by knowledge by calming in speech
and trample those in the districts of the gods land
may he live forever
the influence of a goddess
after it had become evening he came out
see me having reached land
as for him who sails with falsehood for a cargo he does not reach land
whose equal has never been
planning to seize my cattle
he led millions of subjects
son of iah
if you marry a good time girl
and do likewise
i will go and plead concerning you with anubis
then his majesty said
as done for a god who loves mankind
gilukhipa daughter of the prince of naharina satirna
of bread beer oxen and fowl
o may you go
these three boats
in the morning
for this statue of the count
21 hands one horse one chariot
those who were in egypt heard it
land gave me to land
for this statue of the count
may they lead me to the cities of eternity
junit
this humble servant entrusts his chicks
they present her with their children
as for the mortuary priest or any person
while thoth directed the trip
that you arrive safely
he has gone out
overseer of the house
forever and ever
the officials and the soldiers of the whole expedition in its entirety and the children of kep were instructed
who is here with you
his nose behind him
it is yours like your hounds
with making them countless
having taught himself knowledge
a single thing has been destroyed
you have reached old age
ubainer then bent down and picked it up
whoever is under his light will be great in wealth
as they came to engage my majesty
enduring of monuments
so i have now plied my sounding rod
as he had foretold previously
one will not do a thing in abydos
whose hands i joined together for you in victory
so that they could not be reconstructed
his majesty commanded the digging of this canal after his finding it blocked up with stones
and inflicts punishment on him who ought to be punished
one who should hear deaf
a messenger who came north or went south to the residence
when you appeared
for another term on earth
so says his singer
to judge between litigants
and every man is stealing things from his fellow
and your name is the good one in the mind of the officials
without putting it
ahmose justified
as was the desire of her majesty about it
bull stout hearted as he enters the arena
southern boundary made in year 8 under the majesty of
now this peasant said these words
for you have begun to grow old
i have overpowered mankind
if you meet an opponent in his moment
refreshing under his sycamores
his courtiers
and they couldnt go out for fear of the bull
the one whom he humbles will be bearer of travels
at every embankment
and lay down your arrow
and let these nets be given to these women after their clothes have been taken off
it is thanking him for what he does
but i know the place where it is kept
your light opens the eyes of the flock
you were appointed to be a dike for the pauper
how joyful is the land that he rules
and will tear down mendes
governed the land
then two boats were made available to him together with their crew
his sister said
such is death
making a man sad
the people were cheering and exulting
and the overseer of works at the necropolis
im telling you what he did
then the high steward rensi son of meru sent two guards
every high priest
this peasant then went
that is in this flesh of mine
he who should dispel weakness is acting corruptly
at last he sits down
if you are a man of excellence
prince regent count leader of the city
will wish a bier
look you surpass the lady of pestilence
i established the borders of egypt
and hear your petitions
and your heirs established in your positions
without your taking care
esteemed assistant and great chief of ma hedi
lead it for him who knows that you have come forth from him
go to elephantine
but if it expels itself
words said by amun re
and cold as he wishes
confirmed was its sacrificial bread
i have come here to summon you by order
and is throwing me on the fire to burn me up
he shall not be and his son shall not be in his place
beholding silver gold lapis lazuli
in front of his entire army
then we sailed north
the horizon is in another land
i let them know the ritual of every day
dont be afraid peasant
falling in heaps
a ship will come from home
the limits of art cannot be delivered
which is from cedar from conquests of my majesty
consisting of three gallons of barley every day
the wise man nourishes his soul
apart from a nubian who shall come to trade in mirgissa
to be mashed
he divided the great river along its middle
all the gods of upper and lower egypt
i shine for your sake
and one did as everything that his majesty had ordered
all foreign lands serve you
he then fetched it and gave it to its owner
i provided him with offering tables
desire to last as is said
i have fetched you
in fat of pintail duck
if you are excellent found your household
as master as brother or as friend
free of impatience
it is the older princess who unites with the white crown
every servant was at his duty
and five arourae of land in my town
i will not let him go back to egypt
doing what is praised
to whom people were sent to ask for advise
officials
divine seal keeper
33/64 honey
the good god
and your heirs established in your positions
and lead an expedition on water and on land
the gods offerings according to its ratio
i shall do what you wish my way is good
his father a wab priest of the temple of ptah
when the sky is hot
who is pregnant with three children of re lord of sakhbu
my son is a scribe
and to let them see your majesty as the lord of radiance
then she caused to be brought to him a box filled of garmants
this city listens when the lord speaks
then the prince of bakhtan let this god proceed to egypt
my name reeks through you
the 5th time
overseer of works of aakheperkare peniati
foremost
watch over your ka priests
with honey
crossing the river on foot
in addition to what the kings children gave
son of re of his body
but that fat of my body
every man has his face downcast concerning his brothers
for the king
at new years day the opening of the year
and meanwhile his wife and his children
while the kingship of the two lands
whose justice has justice
founded for all eternity
meat offerings were established for them
and every kind of precious stone
but it was not in my heart against you
like a young panther at a resting herd
in the time of the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt nebkaure justified
figs were in it and grapes
to whom people were sent to ask for advise
for another term on earth
and he reported to him what he ordered to be done
when it had been read to me
he is the one great of magic
treasurer baqet
given life
at every feast of the necropolis
now the house of this nemtinakht was at a waterside path
dont be haughty in proportion to your might
in perfect realization
i opened my mouth to my soul
hearing is good as speech is good
one who wrongs his confidant for his client
who will perform this magisterial office in this entire land
with oxen to the harbour
by the expedition of the lord of the two lands
it was not intended
the one who can explain is the one who makes it work
pulled by oxen
may he live like re forever
the name of her father is yuia
i let everyone tarry
his house was his fathers house when he was still a child
the approach hall follows regulations
you will not taste the evil of the river
and his majesty said
on whose words his lady relies
then the high steward rensi son of meru delivered them
has become an enemy
turquoise and every kind of herb from the gods land were on their backs
it was of 30 cubits
for the life prosperity and health of her majesty
and every official
raise him up
and khnum made his limbs healthy
whats with him there
that you are on earth
and he had a wife called meret
and all kinds of fine vegetables
praising the god four times
her mood was exceedingly bad
crossing the river on foot
do not make your own enquiries go direct to him
it has not been overturned since the time of osiris
take years of life
stout hearted sharp of horns invincible
the man is in another place
i investigated what could be useful for this
another remedy for curing
on the day they proceeded to the temple
all kinds of plants
i have said this without boasting and without lie
saying
whom victory was foretold as he came from the womb
purity
may he live forever
i shall recount what has happened to me
and the great kings wife tiy may she live
i deprived their noses of the breath of life
prince regent and count khnumhotep son of nehri
because he loved justice so much
and robs only that
from what you knew of him before
do not block the moment of a great man
who created himself
a thousand of all good and pure things
without expiration of the coming of the appropriate season
who brought you who brought you young man
as should be done
the bearded people of the gods land i placated them for your sake
then the maid said to the people in the household
he is one who bends down horns
and atum and his great ennead
he grants provisions for anyone in his following
and faint from it
he created it as his monument for his father amun re
act for him who acts for you
subverter of the law destroyer of rectitude
alabaster
may the inundation god bring him his offering may he eat with his mouth may he see with his eyes
o living god equal of re
there is no barbarian who associates with a marsh dweller
for the word has taught since the time of ra
with vine
lord of the thrones of the two lands
to do for him his hearts desire
relying on the numerous troops
my son re god who is greater than he who begot him
only on account of his lord
carved out of the mountain on the western side of the euphrates
and he will feel well immediately
this nemtinakht to the officials who were with him
royal seal keeper
i slew its people
who carries out a massacre of everyone
then these gods were brought
thereafter one proceeded to retjenu
day 15
i have provided his protection against you
then i heard thunder
brought by his districts in unet
his place of everlastingness
foremost of those in the west
true favourite of his lady
then djadjaemankh said to him
when he saw the donkeys of this peasant
their utterances concerned the praises and favours towards me
to let you be brought
their tongues were not partial
stop the barque
purity
and have fastened your severed parts
and the fathers and mothers who were with me
without failing
and his majesty said what is this hordedef my son
horus mighty bull perfect of appearance
to be prince regent count leader of the eastern lands
vizier amenemhet
calves were slaughtered goats were sacrificed
a man speaks to another
and answer without stammering
since dusk
to the house of khons in thebes neferhotep
like that of a ruler of any land
vessels and jars of silver
greatly beloved
then he stood up to greet him
then this goddess came in the early morning
follower of the palace
reni justified
vegetables
desire to last as is said
director of works at the rock tomb of the king
the return of the prince from gods land
the king of upper and lower egypt maatkare
as you love life
and they thrashed all his limbs therewith
horus mighty bull appearing in truth
on summer days
all that the sun shines upon
then he said go and bring me the chief lector priest and book scribe djadjaemankh
while they lie in their blood
the sun rises for your sake
i shall return to the place i came from
the prince regent
and the islands of the sea
in fact your possessions are in your house
after i will have guided them by water and by land
as my mouth opens to speak
his opponants
since the time of the god
on which the lord of all reposes
in the courts
never had it been done since the time of king snofru the justified
my son my avenger menkheperre may he live forever
turquoise and every kind of herb from the gods land were on their backs
then he said to them
the bjdj disease of the eyes
who cannot be turned away
sealed chest
has stiff cervical vertebrae
may khons defend me a true scribe
and his friends gave them to him
deputy of the treasurer
to do something that pleases my father osiris
the stomach of the loved will be content
i rebuilt a colonnaded hall that i found in ruins
after he returned in strength in victory and in triumph
you are the steering oar of the land in its entirety
then she heard the noise of singing music making dancing cheering
foreseeing what was to come
among their days of travelling south
but not for cheating
the king of upper and lower egypt nebtawire
and he went on to say to his majesty
to you each day is a moment
i raised the orphan without a father
the fleeing were felled
are you not a man
there will not be a loss of your tomb equipment
what he had planned to do to me
and he who should mitigate is causing suffering
the sight was exceedingly beautiful
there is no yesterday for the negligent
he will not fail to do good to a foreign land
see what is before you is fine knowledge
more than the smell of crocodiles
gold horus who repeats birth
alabaster
and trees that always carry fresh myrrh
as all subjects of my majesty
concerning his rank of leader of the city
beloved of his lord
give your magical protection to him
horus bull in thebes
took charge of its ground plan
a face will not pale at the sight of your face
death is in my sight today
whose excellence was made by min
look you are with me as a servant
mind the dead body and return
another remedy
given life
put into effect the rule i have drawn up
to the supports of heaven
about your beautiful arrival at my temple
and rub himself in
look you are the same
and fetter the bedouin as captives
the scribe loved
i spent many years there
as if a marsh dweller saw himself in elephantine
then he addressed his son
and none will surpass your rectitude
look it is no use to tell you this
ornament of the mistress of heaven
ra speaks concerning that thing
you do not flee
nor did he answer this peasant
give us our beautiful gift
to expel the influence of a god
at this block
before i have come to it
son of re of his body his beloved lord of every foreign land
then they said to his majesty l.p.h.
strong men together with invalids
planning to seize my cattle
coming in peace saying
i will not speak
without him giving anything thereof to his own house
who chased and captured in every foreign land
it will lead to blessedness
and they came in peace to karnak
the fish of the waterside speak to them
the influence of a dead man
as khons the provider in thebes had commanded
my brother
do not make him into someone to approach you
another theme to guide your hearts
i let a troop of recruits come
the other under barley
the caretaker then went
and furniture without limit of southern acacia
what the nile brings from its source
with the shrine of your children bearing your love
then isis said to these gods
their altars were bare
a star fell falling to their south
i have planned doing the useful deed
he is the heir of every god
on the ship the wild bull
he gives food to those who are in his following
thou shalt cause provisions to be given to him
this was copied from start to finish as found in writing
when seen
etc
i was a dutiful administrator of your monuments
i have learned of a commoner who lives in djed snofru
you trample all foreign lands
a brother to the divorced
you cannot come up
a mortuary offering
the haker festival
and reached the residence within two months
my majesty sent
the influence of a god
his beloved
eyes are amazed by this king
and hear your petitions
before his majesty and said
mention my name
when he rises as harakhti
then re said to nun
he will conquer southern lands
i restored their temples
oxen
son of re
o sovereign l.p.h. our lord
now who can sleep till dawn
and he sees the darkness of a north wind arise
now i know the lord of this district
and their properties as well
that he will distance himself from my body
and i overthrew all his enemies
and to let them see your majesty equipped with your regalia
a thousand of alabaster
go down and fetch it from there
i stretched out my own hands
great one free of arrogance
the king of upper and lower egypt nebpehtire justified
the name of her father is yuia
he was found by his majesty at tent ta o
something good
i shine for your sake
if the son of a someone receives what his father says
but look what you are doing is supporting the thief
he reached me as i was standing on the road
ruddjedet was suffering
aakheperka justified
all kinds of sweet smelling herbs
and i should join in the betrayal
at every embankment
here it is in my sight like heaven
and bring me haematite in great quantity
while they brought many precious goods
much feared in the house of the kings mother
by the might of the majesty of this god
amenemhet says
khepri distinguished of birth
an expedition of three thousand sailors
fowl
his majesty commanded that these bulls be driven
in joy
who guides my majesty on the good road
creator who wasnt created
about making provisions for the wife of this peasant
the eldest of the three children who are in the womb of ruddjedet
overseer of works of djeserkare justified peniati
of which my lord l p h said i will cause it to be made for thee
and i rescued the robbed
on the sandbanks of the land while there was nothing
made to restrain the bedouin
lord of abydos
and the number of these bulls brought by him from the hunt 40 bulls
the islands in the middle of the ocean
and the entire land while they are prostrate
vessels of granite
count
beloved of harmachis
male slave pajabdju
am i his companion
more than the creeks of marshes they have fished
or the season of inundation
true and beloved acquaintance of the king
in this flesh of mine
and upper valleys as if they were waterways
the father sent his son to another place when he saw that bad man at the entrance of his house
brought by his districts in unet
who sees all that he made he alone
justified and revered
gold horus perfect of years who enlivens the hearts
and its head at the east side of the audience hall
a large portion of meat and one ball of incense
this is the norm of the divine word
you who should let a man attend his truly good cause
six flies
you say
and every lector priest
but it is a sweet breath from your entrails
more than the smell of bird droppings
of khons the provider in thebes
his first wife
he repelled evil
every land against which i advanced
like khepri appearing in the eyes
the man speaks in this place
with me and the prince of bakhtan
and vigorous soles
and his majesty said
and from the south of wabut
to see this beer
because it ate my barley
for shelter has vanished from the harbour of the entire land
to be mashed
and said to the prophet of khons the provider in thebes
lord of the thrones of the two lands
he has given us breath as he wishes
i shall return to the place i came from
together with a team of stonemasons from the quarry
to let you know that my majesty l.p.h.
the great god who expels disease demons
for to be idle after an attack
given life stability and dominion like re forever
but there can be no tomb for one who rebels against his agency
accompanied by laden ships
i will stamp flat busiris
and one of them was called
in the morning
never descended something like it from this land
is there no road to his majesty
and the northern to naharina
the foremost nobility of my birth was
he sailed southward to khent hen nefer
examinor of mankind
in order to see it
he will not be guilty
the king of upper and lower egypt djeserkare
as you will pass to blessedness
and the overseer of the works of amun hor
which endure on earth
khnum lord of kebehu in abydos
until we return from making music in the north
there will be no rebel against you in what heaven surrounds
as a man should imitate what his father did
who reaches the ends of the earth every day
and the prow rope has been thrown on land
withdraw the flood so as to do justice
i have given you all life and dominion
lord of love more than all other kings
the king of upper and lower egypt nebmaatre
from hatnub
and that on which the sun shines
who is it that has brought thee
that there is no one who could do it but you
and then well make harbour together
yet officials should be people who dispel injustice
my name was good in the entire land
whose coming is awaited by the courtiers
he let his majesty know of his soul
saying
he will not fail to do good to the land which will be loyal to him
my ways are good
look i am pleading with you
beauty of every day
a righteous man whose righteousness has crumbled
rescue all who are drowning
to do their duties
an illness has seized her body
lord of years like the majesty of re
they lauded this excellent god
who is keen on destroying friendship
whom can i talk to today
people who mend a severed head
the sight was exceedingly beautiful
like re forever
when you have done everything that my majesty ordered
while they bowed their heads to the ground
and she became still without rowing
he fights having foreseen the outcome
but you do not hear it
and an apron to the motherless
whenever heaven rages
then it is not biased
you are re lord of heaven with your courtiers
then the majesty of this great god ordered
who wont let an unemployed person through at once
a mortuary offering for the revered
may he live forever our lord
then i conveyed the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperkare justified
i will create a breeze
shall i spend all day at it
no equal to him has been found warrior hero on the battlefield
says he namely atum
i shall return to the primordial water
for he was captured on the side of the town
i will be judged with him
at the front of thebes
i became intimate with his majesty .]
love for me was with its commoners
look the mother of your servant is in her little house when her children are with her
noses are blocked when he falls to raging
then his majesty said go and bring it to me
a pellet of incense is to be put in it unbroken
aakheperkare chosen of re
with the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt nebka justified
founded for all eternity
city of a sovereign that conspires to rebel
on the fire
a daily supply of wine
lo he was a beneficent son
horus mighty bull beloved of maat
consisting in branches of doum palm
two ladies enduring of kingship like re in heaven
one who is truly close
a royal commission executed by
if you are in the approach hall
he subjugated and they acknowledge my lord
falling in heaps
this excellent god
words to be spoken
censers and bowls
in menat khufu
while they lie in their blood
to the residence of the sovereign
ruler of the new settlements
then this peasant came to plead with him for a second time
it is large
went to their wells
while he has pain in his stomach
he says
arrogant
he opened his mouth to me
whom can i talk to today
the vizier was in a state of joy when he saw the beautiful face of his mother
and fasten on the agency of those who do
the islands in the middle of the ocean
the princes of retjenu dragged these flag poles
born of the kings mother seniseneb
perish in a pond surrounded at night by crocodiles
when your self restraint has subdued his excess
so that you may enjoy them
one of you
but provide sustenance for his wife
in front of his entire army
as i was justified on earth
the islanders say
after the viziers finding him
retreat and he will take occasion to act aggressively
an owner of food
flight has taken its toll of you
everything that is
greater was my praise in the palace than that of any unique friend
i freed the oppressed from the powerful
without coming out
lord of the thrones of the two lands
and found that these fields were flooded
have you come to cause silence
content in the place of eternity
he divided the great river along its middle
that one of these peasants comes here
his noble father who loves him is preparing the way for him
and you are rich in every respect
beloved of month lord of thebes who lives in armant
as for one who passes years being praised
overseer of every office in the temple of amun
who judges without partiality
anyone neglecting the happiness of his staff
hearts have become greedy
for look your harbour is surrounded by crocodiles
destroyer of falsehood creator of truth
they no longer had horses
so you should take account of me
then his majesty said to the crocodile
its length being 3700 cubits and its width 600 cubits
may you be in your home with your wife and children
for lack of an intimate friend
i kept my city alive in its entirety
are you a thief then
in the city that you have known
among their days of travelling south
who reaches the ends of the earth every day
his son was sent to him to say this thing to him
and the prince of bakhtan came with his army and his officials
when his majesty is in the palace
is eating my barley
the bank is steep and the ways are under barley
she recognised my excellence in the palace
an offering the king makes
and their naos sistra
every office is under his command
words to be said four times
appoint for yourself people you can trust
of the stonemasons
all kinds of sweet smelling herbs
and anise

to avert agression
he told me this
beseeching my majesty saying
justified rai
while my fame is in the residence
and the majesty of re said
took me in his arms
i equipped the god with his regalia
the gods who attend him were fashioned
the man is in the boat while ra shines on the horizon
i was appointed as overseer of the granaries
and be pleased with their gifts
how joyful is the one to whom this is said
to live in a foreign land
he told me this
free of impatience
do not separate your heart from him
it will mean he is called a fool
and i set fire to them
by the might of the majesty of this god
beetle who raised himself
was it caused by the three children that i mentioned
and i am near to passing away
hidden from the troglodytes and foreigners
for we have seen his might
it came to you by the gifts of the god
a large quantity is from this island
while his majesty l.p.h.] is young
for honesty
if you would call burial to mind
it is to be dried
a thousand oxen
of a dead man or dead woman
i stole away leaping to find myself a hiding place
from beautiful white limestone
it will completely turn into worms
for i have grasped all that his eye revolves around
and the son of their lord
who are experienced in what they know
and load ships to the satisfaction of their hearts
a mortuary offering

how good it is
all kinds of good herbs of the gods land
after he had brought together the borders of its two sides
i made a door of seven cubits of cedar from negau
and most august than they who created him
to carry out the regular watch
then the high steward rensi son of meru said
when you are dead
daughter who subjugated the lords
and these birds were snatching and taking somewhere else
mistress of grace

to be unpacked in the festivity hall
who replies to a matter as befits it
and it is the hand balance that detects deficiency
of the foremost of those in the west
prince turi
it was difficult in the opinion of the people who were dragging great things on it
without your interment by barbarians
like a path washed by rain
i will protect mankind against her
who kept his name alive
and all people of abydos
and detest death
may he give his favour to one who acts faithfully to him
faithfulness to them assures success
his beautiful weapons having been fastened
his majesty then reported to khons in thebes neferhotep saying
it was his majesty who opened its road
and now they brought them as gifts to my majesty
he is an excellent son
and he of the east side
ameny son of amenyaa l.p.h.
to give praise according to my appointment
amenmose may he live forever
every kind of fruit was on its trees
justified
pupil of the king of lower egypt
to see the sun
you did not speak when your name was pronounced
luxor 8 1/2
it struck them opposite to him
accompanied by my troop of recruits
he is the sun in whose leadership people live
thus beautiful women came into being in momemphis
i am a well born man strong and wise
and all favours bestowed on you
my majesty devastated them
while all foreign lands were assembled
but i was deceived
then the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt re came
i have done as what you have said
who did good to his equal
to widen the borders of egypt
my majesty turned them into ruins
begotten by kamutef
called pen nekhbet
in the midst of the pyramids
on which a god lives
none foolish whom you educated
by the pronouncement that issued from the mouth of the majesty of
whom he raised over his nobles
your spirit is with you
without failing
he said
that i might answer what he had said
bearing the beauty
count leader of priests of nekhbet
this god addressed me kindly
confidant of the good god
went to the entrance of the portal
he subjugated and they acknowledge my lord
disclosing to them the unexplored roads
hearts leap up for him
that organ in a man is his canker worm
so that he may be given life
in his ignorance
none are righteous
may he live forever until eternity
a refuge to the subjects
in your bodies
who consorted with the ignorant
a mortuary offering
royal seal keeper and sole companion
save the shipwrecked
childhood
it is i who am the ruler of pwenet
they know that i am their lord
i was stretched out on my belly
courtiers were grieving
beginning of the teaching
rejoicing over his beautiful monument
which was there by the millions
the foreigners of retjenu will not rebel again
that i could distinguish life from death
and said high steward my lord
acquaintance of the king and his cabinet
and he found ruddjedet sitting in grief
he grants provisions for anyone in his following
or who will mutilate its statues
you will not fear
a man remembers a bad thing but does not know the good therein
the influence of a goddess
to be ground and mashed
while the lord of a clan may beg to be followed
he has no children and no heirs on earth
people along with cattle
see with your own eyes
who does what the souls of heliopolis praise
skilled in every difficult thing reni justified
he saw her coming
indeed favour gave birth to him
he saw the emergence of the darkness
i am one who is worthy
i then went south
but you are sated with your bread
similarly if one prayed to any goddess
if something is not for you it is not for her
while his appearance was youthful
ahhotep
all kinds of offerings on which a god lives
great of sacrifice
and each one was outdoing his fellow
loved by ankh re
and every man is stealing things from his fellow
i did not pilfer from the gods offerings
he is more fertile than the great flood
he outdid what had been done since the time of the ancestors
providing their sacrificial bread on earth
those who built in granite
a man remembers a bad thing but does not know the good therein
and the son of their lord
she is ferried across
i am one who says what is good and repeats what is loved
things are robbed by a criminal
gold horus perfect of years who enlivens the hearts
pulled by oxen
where i was with my relatives
and kings who had been before
i placed myself between two bushes
the prince regent
so that he keeps speaking remain silent
with mucus in his neck
and the manifestation of this god was seen
and fat of a cow
in which this god flourishes
ahmose may she live
for years afterwards by those who will emulate what i have done
will lack bread for his statement
creator who wasnt created
your sailing is steadfast under your majesty
as his horses hadnt been rested yet
more secret than the fashion of the underworld
and your grave will not be made
she is the excellent stern rope of lower egypt
from taseti
he let me smite all foreigners
in well being
he loads his harvest into a boat
because of the greatness of the might of his majesty
whom can i talk to today
lord of the thrones of the two lands
about whom is said he belongs to his rival
leader of everything in this entire land
at night i strung my bow shot my arrows
may your majesty command to spend a day of celebration
1/64 flour of dates
finding none who would defy him
seen by those who tread on it
the kingship of upper and lower egypt
he goes outside
sustenance is the king abundance is his word
but without letting a ship of the nubians pass
i opened my barn to everyone
one of the children
sweet with regard to love
your rays are on the face
when he reached old age
the recruits who have been trained by their lord
speaking is more difficult than any labour
reached out his hand
born of the lady of the house and lady of the court saat djehuti .]
like a meeting without a chairman
without deception and without lie
singularly excellent
and his northern to input

the nyw fisherman is killing jy fish

and clothing
let not men see
the king of upper and lower egypt nebukaure
as bread and beer for every day
the great god who expels disease demons
in order to see it
you saw
i was not weak in the opinion of the king
in the mystery of the lord of abydos
a thousand of bread
to seek out him who had rebelled against him in that land
your fame has pervaded the crest of the world
it has come to one whom the god favours
may arsaphes from whose temple you have come praise you
a free for all
patricians were in the necropolis
in our lifetime
a protector who does not fear the rapacious
in whose vicinity there is no resistance
and eases pain
to fight and conspire against my majesty
hearing my name
may it attend to me in this
the northern to the ends
everyone is in joy when they hear it
he said to me
he waits for a boat
as the daughter of the ruler of ma hedi
i overthrew them as he ordered in the way that he used to do
to carry out the regular watch
if you play the son of a man of a council
then the high steward rensi son of meru gave provisions
my lord i have found one of these peasants who is truly eloquent
after the water has taken its toll
people say
to act as king of eternity a horus who endures forever
on this stela of mine
semen of the bull of truth
you will do this successfully
summon to me swift nimble messengers
khentiuash from the interior of keshu
look misfortune is on every side
to heat them
this is the precept
everybody is filled with his love
it being still in its place
given life like re eternally
it has been prepared with every good thing
gold horus being
for me my house and my garden were given back to the owner
and arrived in karnak
day 4 during the feast of amun
who brings advantage to its possessor
their bows their arrows
chief of judgement
bringing the best of the offering table
but there is no straight way in for the one who fails to hear
i did justice sharper than a needle
enter the land by the gift of the king
this is much against me today
my mind was vigilant seeking what would be useful
which were desirable to his heart
has the ferry sunk
prince regent and count khnumhotep son of nehri
then this goddess came in the early morning
bowing to his uraeus
have attached your necks
my name reeks through you
my mace overthrew the asiatics
whom can i talk to today
then the high steward rensi son of meru delivered them
their good child
his majesty arriving to kill the enemies of the vile kush
justified and revered
the influence of a feminine pain demon
female slave wabentasachmet
`hail to you re
nehri son of sobek ankh
i erected it with columns anew

it was done there in an act of massacre
brought as booty of his majesty

prince who is beloved of his father
to the temples
with a cabin
founded by horus
son of re of his body
he is atum himself nebukaure
the foreigners of retjenu will not rebel again
words to be said four times
the puntites unknown to egyptians
he is stout hearted when he attacks the easterners
sacred image of amun
who strikes the southerners and beheads the northerners
the begetter who brings the populace into being
he united for me the black land and the red land
city of amun
fool look you are found out
this was copied from start to finish as found in writing
the water of the river is drunk when you wish

and the overseer of works hor say
and was appointed to be chief of upper egypt
given life forever
to seek out him who had rebelled against him in that land
to startle you
as to that burial
beloved of his city
to rule his city
lord of the thrones of the two lands
the king himself the king of upper and lower egypt maatkare
they are his river field when it floods more important than his riches
but an evil act of someone without need
while his majesty was in thebes
she affiliated me with a statue of her majesty
and to let them see your majesty as avenger
then it will be brought to us
your good name is that you do not speak
and made two guards turn against him with whips
when they saw the beauty of the neshmet barque
rescue me in the domain that is within your reach
as the tributes to upper and lower egypt
and they fled far away from me
he will reside with him
lord of strength
i brought to them their offerings
the king of upper and lower egypt nebtawire
before the princes of punt
as monuments of eternal age
you will make it into a porridge
invocation offerings
seen as a hearer
purified and cleansed from gazelles
and what he had ordered to be done was reported
my ways are good
valiant montu on the battlefield
the king of upper and lower egypt
nothing can ever be done for him
open the roads to the myrrh terraces
that they will give you praise as a god
his flame that drives away his enemies
and then your majesty yourself will plant them
that keeps them alive
every day
many craftsmen rebuilt it
the man who made it
given life forever
in reply to him
vizier

erecting the magnificent flagstaffs in front of the temple
treasurer
it was a beam that broke it for me
you say
and now they brought them as gifts to my majesty
from the action of his heart and his tongue
he has said about it
and djedi said
it is i who reminded myself
the revered the gods father truly beloved of his lord
as for any man who will put his hand
and one turns to strangers
i will be judged with him
now ill speak again to you so hear people
with honey
a thousand of bread
after he had gone to miu
i went with him to his tribe
dont fend off someone who appeals to you
and the majesty of re said
strong men together with invalids
of bread beer cakes oxen and fowl
when i reached the harbour of this city
in the time of fear of the palace
when the construction of this was being done
thou shalt have thy former heart
never had anything similar been done by a king
this means that he who twists speech from its correct sense
whom amun made great
may you perish
the one made to exact it is hated by law
be tender hearted so that you will learn justice
spell against pain
the wind rose and rose again
is it not really him
the son of ra
the kings children as many as they were
whom can i talk to today
a commoner cultivates his plot
the influence of a masculine pain demon
then it is washed
the place where the sound was made
placing a boundary marker at his upper egyptian boundary
smelling the sweet breath of the north wind
who is a poor man and not your equal
as to this grave
he is the great god
as you love life
i commanded you to make them
pen papyrus palette of thoth
who consorted with the ignorant
he did not answer these officials
whereas formerly the majesty of this noble god had been on seven carrying poles
it was a beam that broke it for me
prince regent count acquaintance of the king
all sweetness
the bjdj disease of the eyes
transferring my property to my children
what do you achieve
the man listens to another plan in the city
at the stairway of the great god lord of abydos
who will fetch him
khakaure
a thousand of offerings
greatly loved
do not be jealous of what is not your due
because of appealing to re
perhaps one may have a servant of your choice come to me
he makes bodies weak
and another will come
i was one who was firm
horus mighty bull powerful in strength
she is the wife of a mighty king
she spent the day there while drinking
offerings and sustenance
who confronts the battlefield furiously
eager to seize
as the king of upper and lower egypt usermare sotpenre has commanded
a commoner asks for dinner
what more do you need
a thousand of bread
it will tread grain for its offence
join with your majesty in your hearts
you are the equal of thoth
horus divine of being
the people from my district
another eye cream

i conducted the procession of upwawet
filled with ointment
and passed in ascending and descending
a thousand of bread and beer
do not hold back from the presents of his giving
year 2
and perish
and friends of today dont love each other
who carries out a massacre of the bedouin tribes of asia
who rescues egypt on the battlefield
pain leaves a swelling pain leaves a swelling
and they thrashed all his limbs therewith
may he live forever
sovereign who seized the nine bows
to watch over these wild bulls
with fearful hearts their bodies trembling
the eyes are to be rubbed in with it
who pondered it in the heart
as his boundary to unet
born of the lady of the house kheti
a castle of iron
after he had loaded his donkeys
while i give bread to my neighbour
my brother
the excellent ones and inhabitants of his house
you are hapi who makes the meadows green
there is no one who dares come near to your majesty
that excellent god
given life like re forever
gold horus perfect of years who enlivens the hearts
nebpehtire
he took flight through fear of you
then as the prince of bakhtan was asleep on his bed
and none looked back
the quality of a son of a someone is good for him
i kept alive the name of my father upon them
who overthrows the rebels among the bedouin
but can be found with the women at the grindstone
but your heart is greedy
or with a message
o beloved of the king
the land was in distress
beloved son of his father amun re king of the gods
let me be brought twenty women who have beautiful bodies
desire me here
says
this statue came from the mountain as a block
that you cannot be prudent
total 96 bulls
consisting of three gallons of barley every day
nebipw sesostris
who creeps in
the man is in another place
her uncle then went to tell this to ruddjedet
the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperenre justified
i restored their mortuary chapels
so you should inquire
since i expected there would be contention
childhood
and the majesty of this god said
at the coming forth of the hm ntr priest
making his monument
what the sky gives
patient craftsman
strong ruler who has destroyed the nubians
the lord of the two land nebmaatre
ssndm wood
in very good peace
which happened on this island
now may you see my character
my majesty hunted them a herd of 120
that my mother proceeded to become regentess and countess
while all foreign lands are under your feet
when his majesty was in naharina according to his annual custom
all of the possessions of the temple are in their proper places when the priest commanded its inspection
and her gaze was pleased by it
3 xt n snj trees
then one of the donkeys filled
and meanwhile his wife and his children
but i couldnt find any
when the prince regent and count nakht son of khnumhotep justified and revered petitioned
as son of a count into the inheritance
there is no artist whose talent is fulfilled
to complain to
fragrance from the palace
foremost of those in the west
investigating what was of old
gods father and beloved of the god
when he makes a good gesture do not be silent
initiate the noble and recite on his name
then he spread it out on the waterside path
hail to you
when this peasant had said these words
and his friends gave them to him
hearts have become greedy
an illness has seized her body
and his majesty proceeded to his palace
and all your conduct will be good before god
the mother of a boy
and fat of a cow
who hastens
whom can i talk to today
his majesty returned every time
that i might answer what he had said
may you perish
the man with power in a task turns about
who will fetch him
the beloved of the king will be blessed
a thousand men are tied against what is good for them
and he doesnt look at his belly
and their possessions as well
then this nemtinakht said
inspiring fear greatly respected
as you are in the favour of your ruler
and to your forefathers who are in the necropolis
and took away their food
all wood is splintered like a papyrus reed
that he may be given very much life
the one with powerful arm who tramples his enemies
every one thereof
strong armed men said
o that thou mayst act according as i say
as it is good to listen to people
to say to those who will hear
his children will not be devotees
and he was given ten loaves of bread and two jars of beer every day
while her labour was difficult
then the boat sank
and may the lord of the stars protect you
to walk about enjoying shooting
gold horus who repeats birth
who has come with many gifts for the queen
in your hereditary offices
the woman pleased the heart of his majesty very much more than anything
who was in charge of the garden to say
the king of upper and lower egypt djeserkare
incense oil
it is the result of the hot headed
he gave me the land in its length and its breadth
he will never be equalled
prince ahmose
saasx plants black eye paint
noses are blocked when he falls to raging
it is not an act of people
and the nubian nomads are carrying tributes
i spent the day at the edge of a field
pass over him do not recall it
of bread
as my majesty has recognized
high steward my lord greatest of the great
when i heard the bellowing of cattle
the king of upper and lower egypt lord of the two lands
my name reeks through you
since dusk
this bad plan
he found him an enemy whom one could fight
a single one of them put forth the strength of a thousand men
ushering me
silence is how you establish your superiority over him
and memory of me is in his palace
all kinds of precious stones
his majesty offered an example thereof in the temple of amun
semen of the bull of truth
i begot her for me
everything that is
let the prince of bakhtan make a great offering before this spirit
i let the divine ship sail
the one who overlooks laws is punished
faces are blank
i perpetuated the name of my father
a sem priest with clean fingers
your life will endure on earth
bronze
and i will find him
he built his monuments in input
attractive to the heart
beneficent mother
and that is something that the chief lector priest djadjaemankh did
and they returned to the house
given life like re forever
a hundred jars of beer
and found that these fields were flooded
he captured a herd of twelve wild bulls
to crush rebellion throughout the lands
my limbs failed
from hatnub
daily you present yourself in the morning
to the good god of the primordial time
welcome in peace o gracious one
it was a good land called araru
then he took a bundle of flax to her
in a boat 120 cubits long
when you take your place of eternity
and the entire land while they are prostrate
does the cow reproduce for the hard man
then his majesty said
it is your spirit good god lord of the two lands
who worships him will be protected by his arm
so the son of meru must go astray
whom the longhorn is charging
and this goddess said
and the heart of his majesty was gladdened by seeing them row
born of the lady of the house tesh
perhaps it is a peasant of his who went to someone else beside him
the king of upper and lower egypt menkheperre
a wonder that happened to his majesty
he has been eating bread and drinking beer
i will go to heaven
i came to let you crush the princes of palestine
is it the case that i have opened his hurdle
as a teaching before his children
and a mask of lapis lazuli
wenen nefer
you speak to me
will you even find another peasant like me
and their arms grew strong
to let you know that your roving through lands
this is three times to induce him to act
all his serfs and cattle
like when satiety comes and ends hunger
divine king going forth on the day of victory like month
the spear of a hothead flies past
amun re king of the gods it is his father who fashioned his beauty
helmsman dont let your ship go off course
because of letting its choice offerings be given
when he is peaceful people breathe his air
in menat khufu
real galena
beloved of amun re
and who will pass this stela
i was in the favour of his majesty every day
and drink your beer forever
every scribe
which were assigned
before the princes of punt
the great god who expels disease demons
do not answer good with bad
one who was happy becomes anxious
given life
infirmity has developed old age has befallen

the fear of his majesty is in this land
going with her face towards the people before her
given vent to what was on my mind

a gale came up while we were at sea
his majesty tarried four days
with which i could rob the goods of this peasant

he placed all of the foreign lands under your two feet to grant knowledge of his great strength
deputy of the overseer of works of heliopolis in upper egypt

it is heartache
as done for the kings children
the princes of all foreign lands are gathered in your grasp

who was brought alive as captive
its children are cheering
and this peasant had him report back
in order to perpetuate his name forever
not a donkey died
concerning their opposing a briber
their utterances concerned the praises and favours towards me
as all subjects of my majesty
strength is waning through the tiredness of my heart
from the interior of araru
as the first victory
a good crossing or not
to the chief lector priest and book scribe djadjaemankh

and these gods came at his two sides kneeling to the ground
foremost of those in the west
prince regent and count
death is in my sight today
and departed early the next day
but what is the gain thereof to you
after he had exercised kingship
when it was reported to the royal herald

who once listened to the gods
what the land produces
but your name still lives
you are alive
that you pass on your offices to your children
`i was administrator in your harem

so that it will not be freezing
then his majesty said
on which the lord of all reposes
their hands are full of sed festivals of all eternity
so this god spent three years and nine months in bakhtan

son of re of his body tuthmosis shining like re
and what they did was good
he travelled north on it his heart being glad having slain his enemies
two ladies perfect of birth
prince regent
then his majesty said
in dread of me throughout all foreign lands

while i have white and fine linen
counts were appointed in front
i said to him answering him
my face was not spat on
no disaster will befall your rudder stock
and dont listen to anyone who is against him
and minos
for the spirit of the owner of this tomb
are you unaware of my case
it belongs to the high steward rensi son of meru
like going outside
while maidservants grind barley for beer
so that they could not be reconstructed
a ship could not sail on it
you are re lord of heaven with your courtiers
he is eager when he sees the east
i saw the digging of the rock tomb of his majesty in private
live
because of speech that you fear will bring reproof
i spent many years
but an evil act of someone without need
evil is placed near you
the servant of the king will have revered status
i came to let you crush the western land

and asiatics will not bury you
that dough is to be placed in it
and they locked the room with her and them in it
like sitting on the shore of drunkenness
he did not answer these officials

which means it is made to thrive
have you travelled on water or on land
he had concealed it
as the king is rejuvenating in your lives

when i came to her
i begot her for me
it gives no results in anything
royal seal keeper
to their towns
`i was administrator in your harem
who has passed to blessedness
your avarice will befool you
his majesty commanded the erection of this stela
after he has spent many years
the two banks say
beloved sole companion
heedless of all else
brothers are evil
and the overseer of the works of amun hor
he entrusted to her the heritage of the two lands
they strike down his opponents for him

for honesty
founded on me
he was a falcon of gold and flew to the sky toward egypt
the great god who expels disease demons
and see what is done there
so that evil doesnt reach you
possessor of geese numerous in birds
the prince of bakhtan stood by with his army
your quelling her is water

but to his majesty himself it was revealed
horus mighty bull perfect of appearance

a fan
gods of gold

you cannot fear him who submits it to you
he took the inheritance of his begetter
i refresh myself under the sycamores
ahhotep
has stiff cervical vertebrae
whom can i talk to today
made for you by your beloved son
may the king of egypt be merciful to me
when he spent a moment of recreation
when he came from naharina
much came to me because of the love of me
then this humble servant came southward
you will prepare laxatives for him
brought by his districts in unet
transferring his property to his children
the house of the scribe
without him suffering therein
its stronghold in the swamp land
when he is peaceful people breathe his air
mut mistress of asheru lady of all the gods
and my monuments last in the house of my father osiris
i didnt give of it to the asiatics
another remedy for making urine come out
a truly correct man who strays
he is not my son
for this statue of the count
their hearts were weak in their bodies
your heart is the weight and your lips are its arms
have you come to hurt him
and argues
foremost in the land of the horizon dwellers
i was one who was self controlled friendly kind
do not scorn the childless man
like when the sky becomes calm after a heavy storm
the companions of the palace sent a message
and it has reached the end of the earth
the influence of a god
and you will catch fatted fowl
who satisfies the two banks when she speaks
a single thing has been destroyed
on the fire
their cattle without limit
and i cannot slay them until i have heard what you might say about it
and the ruler of eternity
who will be is his creation
after i will have entered the myrrh terraces
to expel
that foreign land
if he is alive there are his arms
youths from east unet
let your eye go that it may smite them for you
that saves me from death
and she became well instantly
for the first time
the appeaser is causing misery
the majesty of
ra is with this man
son of the ruler of unet
1/8 wheat
beloved of his city
he is atum at the tying of necks
and his majesty l.p.h. said to the royal wife in khnemsut
tore out their barley
of exceedingly great weight
he repelled evil
who reports affairs inside the palace
one constructs there for the palace l.p.h.
but look you are the lake that pulls him under
his beloved who protects the father who begot him
with them
in the season of harvest
may she pass eternity above me
good god son of amun offspring of re harakhti
but why do you not hear
his majesty came in joy
and faint from it
1/4 dates
when you set
the walls ordained by the lord of all
i damaged his towns and his people

the majesty of re said

it is more than exaggeration
of exceedingly great weight

my ways are good
i was one who listened to what his superior had said
and to let them see your majesty as shooting star
oxen
one does not help now who has given help
but he gave them to a friend of his and it was he who gave them to him
and he sees the darkness of a north wind arise
travelling and returning safely
the hnwtjw people are dancing in homage to his majesty
do not attack one who cannot attack

high steward my lord greatest of the great
and had heard of my experience

mistress of heaven weret hekau
the 12th hour of the day
a royal offering
as for a temple day it is the three hundred and sixtieth part of the year
inclined to examine matters
there is no one who has returned from there
it will lead to blessedness
it is the evil man who destroys his home ground
to heat them
son of re sesostris
in his 2nd position
there is no grave for him who rebels against his majesty
but i was like a man in the dusk
the high steward rensi son of meru
in qanefru nefru
barley was there and emmer
according to what i did in this land
and every kind of precious stone
if the son is lazy there is still the wab priest
a great one who is greedy is not really great
and in his hand it was a crocodile of wax
he is in the boat
something useful to whoever heeds
gold horus powerful of arms who drives away the nine bows
an attack of thirst overtook me
and gave him very many gifts of every good thing
the gods land that has not been entered
for i am burdened
2 jars of beer
but you do not hear it
he is the one who restrains every thief in this entire land
who perpetuates the names of the ancestors
from the stories of the ancestors
and do not listen to it
he is possessor of wisdom
the king of upper and lower egypt lord of the two lands aakheperkare
that he might celebrate millions of sed festivals
no eye had seen it
and as to exchange the region where he had roamed the earth
a champion whom he put on earth
retjenu is under my feet
companion of the holiday
you say
but provide sustenance for the wife of this peasant
as for him who is enriched by it
one will not hear your name
his beloved wife iuri
who joines with the body of sekhmet
offering on the altar
greeting o blessed one
because of the greatness of the might of this noble god amun re
for he will not be swayed for you
at last he sits down
hearts have become greedy
then i answered this to him
with oxen to the harbour
all my serfs and my cattle
he of edfu great god lord of heaven
overseer of the administration
for my need is heavy
and swallowed for four days
whose equal has never been
`i was administrator of the west side
for whom all is done that she says
and double doors of five cubits and two palms
then his majesty said to her
begotten by the god with the secret name
they had not imagined the things i did
it will completely turn into worms
and they said to his majesty
to fetch for him precious goods from every foreign land
or any poor man
the gods and goddesses who are in this land
who kept his name alive
like re forever
the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperkare
ive gone through every room of the palace l.p.h.
then he measured for her
may arsaphes from whose temple you have come praise you
i would say to someone who is about to go
the fear of my god was in my mind
and fled quickly to their town
and he said high steward my lord
like everything he had said
royal seal keeper
every feast of the happy living and of the dead
and falsehood will be cast on the ground
the commoner said to the wife of ubainer
who leaned on a child
who smites the nomads of nubia
the thrones of the two lands
tolerate one misdeed and it will become two
royal confidant
as to him who shall lose it
and to let them see your majesty as possessing the wings of horus
and this peasant came to plead with him for an eighth time
a man from the delta in taseti
the lord of the two lands was in a state of joy on account of this great construction project
what can papyrus achieve on a mountain
mayst thou go out and in without being driven back and without being turned away from the door of the netherworld
and to become the wife of the prince regent count
my lord has come to tjeret
while he let city know its boundary with city
and his majesty brought him away as captive
ships were manned and laden with riches
there can be no heir for the mean spirited
he who attacks you is the one they have condemned
all tributes to the temples were increased
and children
1/8 leaf of reed
with the high steward rensi son of meru
who followed his lord in his strides
so take care that he doesnt drown
thereupon this official placed the command before me as follows

on account of bentresh
i was a friend of the common people
you are just like the balance
who acted justly as you wished
mistress of all the gods
and found bentresh possessed by a spirit
welcome in peace o gracious one
with me and the prince of bakhtan

that i might answer what he had said
to behold his fields and his cattle
the king of upper and lower egypt kheperkare may he live forever

and wearing of fillets
he saw the emergence of the darkness
i reared her eldest daughter the kings daughter
and grew rich in cattle
an official who solves difficulties
then he created magical protection for khons the provider in thebes
knowing the outcome
who brought you to his island in the sea
beer
his majesty established the southern border at heh
the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt re rose early
which he planted on earth under the favour of this noble god amun
the leader of the city and vizier ptahhotep
but the high steward rensi son of meru remained silent
and all good and pure things on which a god lives
the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperkare
i gladdened the hearts of the eastern deserts
of ptah south of his wall lord of ankh tawi
let me say what is great may you listen
who know the instructions
and rub himself in
according to this state that i was in
chief of the six great ones
the portions of the two lords are under his supervision
the requisites for a mortuary offering of bread beer oxen and fowl
they will succumb to the knives of horus imi shenut
who was in charge of the garden to say
in the time of fear of the palace
priests of the king of upper and lower egypt
o tomb
in the barge in which prince hordedef was
when you answer the speech of a fiery man
the overseer of the sculptors carved in it
then re said to nun
her head averted
the crew of re is driving in their mooring post
so that you may lead the living forever
the people retreat from him
he attackes every land with his strength
because of punishing the evil of one who does it
is evil in every respect
i was leader of all craftsmen
i grew up in the town of nekheb
the cultivator of wickedness is watering his garden with evil
he gave them to friends of his
then it is ground
who went in peace
your condition is like that of one who lives before the infirmity of old age
the slaying is not repeated
the divine body merging with him who created him
as my majesty has recognized
within this city
and none light of heart who is weighty of thought
he is praised for his sheltering
tjenenut
i came to let you crush libya
as the sun sets and rises
khnumhotep son of neheri justified
vizier amenemhet
the servant of this wab priest bathes herself in the pool with all his daughters

his son amenemhet
that gave air to this colonnaded hall

made from a single copper plate
their gates being closed because of it
no instruction was given to me by an elder

who was fashioned by the lords of the great house
who is among the gods
then he proceeded with him to the river bank
he captured a rhinoceros by shooting in the southern land of taseti
someone who suffers from mucus in his throat
as you repeat his feasts
who leaves the outer chamber
would that a moment would destroy
then the high steward rensi son of meru said
and found him emerging from the gate of the temple of arsaphes
on the river from fresh cedar from lebanon
he is a king who conquered in the egg
of the pure stone of this mountain
none is content there
then he made a great offering
whom can i talk to today

to their towns
this is the gift of sustenance this and the god
my majesty has seen them
one ox and two balls of incense
with my arm with my bow
the children of the steward
they gave him the shores and the lands in a single moment
this thing that the commoner had been doing in his house with his wife
to whom great ones come while they are bowing
vizier of horus in his appearances
i rebuilt a colonnaded hall that i found in ruins
he who fills for another is withholding from his amount
to what will happen
for i have grasped all that his eye revolves around
as your gods praise you
every land being its subject
now afterwards
a herdsman of evil brings misery to his cattle
it is to be dried
yes i know how to sovereign l.p.h. my lord
two ladies who makes truth appear
one ox and two balls of incense
followed by the princes of this foreign land
the one called an heir is the one who does favour

like the smell of myrrh

on the sandbanks of nedit

one with powerful arm the like of whom has never been
so that he makes the odour of the temple sweet
you are in the house
all foreign lands together carrying their gifts
he placed himself on his belly saying

16 carob trees
something good
my very many wonders are for you
son of re of his body his beloved lord of every foreign land
the kingship of upper and lower egypt

and this goddess said
words to be spoken
the god who formed my ba
he opens up the creation
officials are giving to you
my majesty myself says

o beloved of his city god
horus who repeats birth
a thousand of oxen and fowl
appearing on the backs of his victims
in his neck
cleanse yourself by his oath
i will stamp flat busiris
i was served from the table of the king
among the blessed
then khons in thebes neferhotep proceeded to khons the provider
until his urine comes out
the villain is an intimate friend
creatures from the hills came down to him
anubus on his mountain the one of embalming
has pain in his head
there is nother that is not in it
may he live forever
gold horus divine of appearance
he placed the fear of me among all foreigners
people along with cattle
you were appointed to be a dike for the pauper
you have come to us to be merciful to us
as follower of the king in his strides at every place
says
every man teaches by his deeds
you have grown old
brothers are evil
you show no mercy you are not troubled
without letting him know
the season of growing
who have well developed bosoms who have braided hair
then reusre returned coming from the land
his place of everlastingness
now another victory that re commanded for me
i was one who was knowledgeable
be seated
they were in the valley of qina
any commoner
the good god lord of rituals menkheperre
in an hour at the time of breakfast
lord of the horizon dwellers
the prince regent
on this good day
and my heart is laden with grief
and i rescued those who were far away from the foreigners
without fault
because their hearts are fearful about what i said to them
of the first generation
it was difficult in the opinion of the people who were dragging great things on it
the boat of the wab priest
birds of pray above this were numerous
1/4 dates
if it is a stand balance
all pure things are pure
catches fish and snares birds
to widen the borders of egypt
as the first victory
eldest horus within lower heaven
none ignorant whom you let know
son of re amenemhet
may he live forever until eternity
and his two plumes danced
death is in my sight today
she is served
she is meaner than her daughter
about whom a lie has been told involving a man
rudder of the earth
i do not weep for that mother
vizier leader of all the officials of the judicial office
since the god of those who had received the white crown
praised by all her gods
with the shrine of your children bearing your love
lord of joy
a ship could not sail on it
hail to you celestial disk of the day
horus mighty bull beloved of maat
they were in the valley of qina
then these gods proceeded
royal confidant
his heat scorches more than the flame of the torch
they all went on donkeys
standing at his gate
during this that khons the provider in thebes and the spirit did
such has never been seen in the annals of the previous kings
he should stand on yonder side
o may your majesty proceed to the lake of the palace l.p.h.
in the middle of the night
to gladden the heart of this humble servant
with bread from the royal breakfast
a free for all
he who should punish injustice is doing evil
they strike down his opponents for him
do not react against him by destroying him
suppress your choice for the good of him who enters humbly
if you go down to the lake of truth
when his back is turned
royal seal keeper
i was uninjured without force applied to me
and there is no mans heart
and let there be given one cake one jug of beer
and the prince of bakhtan organized a day of celebration for them
his protection is at the back of the giving of his powers
a king who will perform the kingship in this entire land
welcome to me
so that they may be given the breath of life
it is the evil man who destroys his home ground
with excellent plans
and who do not neglect what they were commanded
the memory of them moves in the mouth of people
who is praised by his lord is not insolent
and every kind of precious stone
he sees me as you are doing when you open
born of baqet justified and revered
or anything good that may be done with them
for inspection by the lord of the gods
the good god sesostris
and captor
it is more useful for him who does it than him for whom it is done
since the time of the god
counts were appointed in front
then his majesty took counsel with his heart
there was no fear
an oracle from the god himself
its western side to input
he grants provisions for anyone in his following
founded upon the praise of his perfection
then isis said
someone who suffers from mucus in his throat
nor did he answer this peasant
good boats
anyone who is experienced in it is keen sighted
to create his statue for eternity
i seized the southerners under the command of his spirit
this was copied from start to finish as found in writing
who was generous to common people
summon a man concerning his just cause
near the sea to receive the princes of this foreign land
since your eye is on those who scheme against you
for i knew that you are content with justice
because of the difficulty of standing and sitting
may he live forever
the primeval god who created your beauty
horus mighty bull appearing in thebes
so that my name will endure
thus sachmet came into being concoction of the night
they were under my supervision
it is a vile twist to shoot the enemy
daughter of a king and mother of a king noblewoman
when he spent a moment of recreation
herald
concerning his just cause
i was highest administrator of all works
there he is on the road
gold horus great of strength who smites the asiatics
master of secrets of the house of the king may he live flourish and be well
made better than they were before
thus beautiful women came into being in momemphis
because of the difficult stone on the ground
from the lands of his father min
fenugreek
and goodness is cast on the ground
his majesty perceived the conspiring that was done against him by mankind
and you will see the residence where you grew up
his bones were strong his limbs were destined to be of gold
i was parched and my throat was dry
said by
for the spirit of
and of those aboard none remained
i have become like a bull of cattle in the midst of other cows
catches fish and snares birds
and found him emerging from the gate of the temple of arsaphes
he who should correct another is being crooked
you dont have much myrrh
this woman listens to the scribe
his majesty endowed me with labourers
peniati
1/8 leaf of reed
i am the king great of strength
the barley brims over since it is so abundant
he gave them to friends of his
command and it will be done
to inspire awe by being silent is greater
he is like another man
and did not know myself before him
it being still in its place
and live like re forever
men as well as women are cheering him
this goddess returned after she had slain mankind in the desert
and her side became still without rowing
to prepare the road for it
it is tiresome to speak to you
and what one city had taken from another
we administered great monuments
or in these members of mine
this island to which one must come
i reached the old age of the honoured elders
at her going out into the daylight in order to see her house
then the spirit went in peace to where he wished
king of the gods
kindness has vanished
horemmekhib
whereas its old troops have entered into citizenship
and recited to her
leader of all that is not and all that is
whose rich ones have one richer
we come and let his children after him prosper
in order to be glorious and mighty
overseer of the administration
said by
whose plans do not fail
the vigilant leader of the kings mother
sechem faw amun
with whose plans the lord of the two lands is satisfied
but if you flay him his thoughts turn to homelessness
in the temples of upper egypt
barriers from him arise against the one who disputes with him
for the first time
do not hold back from the presents of his giving
he who should rest is making people pant
by sobek re
the foremost nobility of my birth was
i answered this with the answer of a frightened man
what has my lord said to me
but who is there is a god who lives
like of sekhmet in a year of pestilence
1/4 dates
who knew what was said in every office
and muskmelon as if cultivated
and he was given ten loaves of bread and two jars of beer every day
i was not haughty before
in joy
i am sweet of love in the opinion of his lord who is generous to all of the people of his town
by not clashing with him in his moment
clothing
after his majesty had slain the bedouin tribes of asia
if you are a leader
and my duty of clothing priest
to complain to
and the place where it went with him never became known
a hundred jars of beer
and so it happened that she disrupted her side
which was called the thrones of the two lands among the people
and they put them in the barley
my soul opened his mouth to me
his beard was bigger than 2 cubits
i was one who was kind
osiris foremost of those in the west
unet is celebrating
saviour of one who has none
anticipating inferiors
who is united with your head
your earnings are in the estate
as you pass on your offices to your children after a good old age
does a bull want to fight
the inhabitants of the aegean sea and the rebellious lands
i took 110 years of life
i had spent a year and a half there
a refuge to the subjects
for him who prays to see it come
these 3 children
the fourth time already of pleading with you
you are pure of habit
i opened my mouth to my soul
while they smite his enemies for him
an old document
together with tributes of all foreign lands
and this peasant said
when you go down in the western mountain
the hearer is the master of what is useful
they had not imagined the things i did
you will not see the face of fear
may it attend to me in this
to be put in water
o eldest god in whom i came into being
i sanctified their chapels for the future
if my soul listens to me
such has not happened to other kings
i am a noble to be heard
this nemtinakht then said to a servant of his
the influence of a masculine pain demon the influence of a feminine pain demon
so that you may do her every good deed in the necropolis
no one will reach them except your explorers
by the prince regent and count
and no holiday for the greedy
the majesty of this god then said
likewise you have completed the hours of the night
was under the guidance of your own heart
then ruddjedet became pure in a purification of fourteen days
to be mixed
so that his name might live in the mouths of the people
about this grievance
vile kush is preparing to rebel
because he loved her more than anything
to make its beautiful trip at the beginning of the year .]

while maidservants grind barley for beer
i let egypt be chief
sehetepibre
he guides the scribes to correctness
he will lead you through a good lifetime
then his majesty said
amun re lord of the thrones of the two lands
then his majesty proceeed upon his chariot of electrum
given life stability dominion and health
you are like the messenger of khenty
come with them to the palace
knowing the exact moment of this day
while he has pain
who takes what he sees at will
while restoring the northern like heaven
now i know the lord of this district
which his majesty gave to the temple of amun
i went around my encampment cheering saying
you say
a district overseer who should restrain robbery
count
and it was pleasure to my heart
the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperkare justified
or the influence of anything bad
you crossed the water of the euphrates of naharina
1/4 seed of juniper
and to the inheritance of the father of his mother
kamose
there is no misstatement therein
because it is more beneficial to him who does it than to him for whom it is done
so that my name might be excellent upon every monument that i built
and they presented them to his majesty
that he will distance himself from my body
how fine is this house of yours
chief of commanders
loved by re
as the king of upper and lower egypt usermare sotpenre has commanded
one came to tell his majesty
my majesty sends you to do this
as you pass on your offices to your children
when he shoots at a copper target
like a praise singer does
legible
10 cubits by 10 cubits on its every side
you are given slaves of great strength and kind hearted slaves
then the chief lector priest djadjaemankh said his magic spell
but who is there stands in a barque
your silence is more benefit than creeping talk
feebleness has come weakness is renewed
and you have not spoken in the council of officials
to another man
made longer and wider than before
all excellent works together were under my authority
who enters the turmoil of battle
our lord sent his servant to another city on account of this construction project
you are ra lord of the heavens
dont disregard someone you know
as for him who sails with it
the king of upper and lower egypt djeserkare justified
in the morning
and this peasant came to plead with him for a ninth time
before i have come to it
so you say
and your house will be fixed on its goods
as that of min in a year when he comes
and the overseer of works hor say
who will pass this tomb chapel
then he said to me
until i reached the town of usu
i was sent by my lord l.p.h.
to prepare the road for it
to the place where his majesty was
and he went down to the pool
who carries out a massacre of everyone
a constriction of urine
wealthy and great in every respect
one will find its trustworthiness
to the priests of abydos
a son who hears will be without any evils
pleading with this nemtinakht
he was not born to me
it is commissioning something from a craftsman
two ladies who rejoices in truth
truth is an aspect of falsehood
how beautiful it is when a son receives what his father says
while they see their lord
instruct your son to be a good hearer
he doesnt repeat the slaying
look mankind which issued from my eye
the second time the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperkare bestowed on me another favour
until the moment that he returns to his house
but you are sated with your bread
who created him for his own creation
may re hear my utterance
who saves him from the west
ramesse beloved of amun
while he has pain in his stomach
subservient to him are the islands of the ocean
look they have fled to the desert
whoever leaves the store cannot enter
their large chariots of gold and silver
he had concealed it
resist approaching the wife
the king of upper and lower egypt sehotepibre
after i had cleared the path for the god
and they accomplish nothing when your majesty goes down
the hearer becomes one who is heard
let me say what is great may you listen
tell me what you would do about it
i am the one who is speaking to you
temple of hathor 8 1/2
may they give
then she went to draw some water for herself
i am a just person
so that they may be given the breath of life
and presented them to his majesty l.p.h.
but look your donkey
and she said to me
year 47 third month of the season of inundation day 10
the city was gathered rejoicing
the learned man then arrived in bakhtan
my character was wise
this decree from the king has been brought to you
to the place where i came into being
he can tell the same to his children
and placed the gifts that the prince of bakhtan had given him of every good thing
he is horus with a powerful arm a excellent fortress to his army
i was clothed in fine linen
who was generous to common people
the number brought by his majesty from the hunt on this day was 56 bulls
followed by the princes of this foreign land
and kings mother tetisheri
servant of the palace sinuhe says
as you pass on your offices to your children
years were made to vanish from my body
and westerners and easterners are under your command
its old are rejuvenated
for lack of a survivor
as a favour of the sovereign
that i didnt think i would survive
heat as he wishes
listen up if you wish to be secure
look you are a cook whose joy is to slaughter
in the years after ruin
his skin was gilded
i was rewarded with gold once more
i spent 110 years of life which the king gave to me
horus mighty bull beloved of maat
if one were to recount a deed by its name
a troublemaker is a man with no mind
there were two observers
lo i was standing and i heard or as i was standing i heard
to step into his official boat
and you will make another soul who is hot envious
glory and might sustenance and wealth
who strikes the southerners and beheads the northerners
a servant of the royal harem
while a servant at his head was anointing him
together with its inhabitants
she has no enemies among the southerners
whom his lord raised over millions
his character in this is well known to the officials
and him who was on it as captive
look ra is in the heavens
and his majesty captured it
without expiration of the coming of the appropriate season
this statue came from the mountain as a block
it happened to the majesty of my lord
as i have seen an example of his learning
the keeper of the diadem
going north or south
of myrrh malabathrum
male slave pamedjai
to the spirit of the priest of horus of edfu
do not impose her in affairs
wbn plants
it was learned of by hearsay
and this haematite was brought to him
on which one may rely
you have delivered the poor from evil
prince regent count acquaintance of the king
the things that he said
if what he has seen come out through him
when the builders became gods
then isis said
how good when a a son listens to his father
the singer neferhotep
i did not intend to come to this residence
to the temples
fight for his name
you are the equal of thoth
one whom he had led astray to another land
and its excess perishes on the ground
another eye cream
over whom nemti rejoices
to thank the god for him
kissing the ground for the foremost of those in the west
in the midst of his army
the sovereign bestowed on me another favour
great is the fear of you
count
that he flees on the day of suffering
is under your command
havoc in your vineyard
my brother
then they made the sky turn into storm and rain
and all good products of this foreign land
who rises in the morning
to be crushed with honey
says
another remedy for curing
like water that quenches thirst
its youths are refreshed
this was copied from start to finish as found in writing
and to the inheritance of the father of my mother
like fire that cooks what is raw
in the name of my majesty l.p.h.
i slew him with his axe
who smites the nomads of nubia
he is atum himself nebukaure
the only one of his kind
you receive praise from those you do not know
and created magical protection for the daughter of the prince of bakhtan
his opponants will be beneath
as i was standing in the middle of my tribe
with poles of ssndm wood
bakhtan is your home
it is to be rubbed in
my house was made wealthy before me
so that he would govern the black land
revered in his district
a thirsty mans approach of water
for whom there is no escape from the west
with its construction for all eternity
beware of the approach of eternity
and i was assigned high fields and low fields
elevated according to their offices
amenemhet says
he who should reproach another is an evildoer
it struck them opposite to him
in festivity
it is i who presented the hands
his beautiful weapons having been fastened
everytime he takes aim
there can be no opportunity for riches for an evil man
what has come to your mind
those abominated by god
who sees to eternity
as for a judge who ought to be punished
beloved and given life like re
in the midst of those of the kings children
his heir who cheers in joy
he said to me
that you remain at your places
to be eaten for one day
i crouched down in a bush
the great ones of abydus
and he does the matter that angers you about him
hunting in any foreign land
he said high steward my lord
your yards will not break
the one whose house is empty his foundation wavers
to avoid suffering in his matter
and her gaze was pleased by it
that he might present his issue before the father of the eldest
a refuge to the subjects
then she drank and it pleased her heart
who created mankind the king of the people
look they have fled to the desert
sole companion
one does not help now who has given help
near me
the mother of a boy
that you should fear your punishment
devoted to the king
he listens
and seeing the beauty of upwawet
you will be happy here with me
a ruler equal of re
gutted fish and plucked fowl
for now you have begun to grow old
his majesty celebrated the feast of the opening of the lakes
follower of the palace
so that i may tell him the words of those who have heard
is no more
this is better than anything
meals were brought to me
if you are to be a leader
i inscribed what i did upon every monument
another scribe hears this plan
their large chariots of gold and silver
the lords of sanctuaries are jubilating
then boats were prepared for prince hordedef
lector priest
we come to bring it
cheating diminishes justice so render good account
i have given you all life and dominion
whoever is under his light will be great in wealth
loading of ships to a very large extent
copy of the reply to this decree
lord of the foreign lands chief of the troglodytes
while thoth directed the trip
as perished as those who have never been
as the first victory
and he loved me for he knew that i was valiant
gold horus living of birth
loyal to his lord
his mouth is abundance
a very strongly approving nod
may he live forever
may thy majesty do as he wills
sehetepibre
whom he raised over his servants
every man has his face downcast concerning his brothers
of the servants of the kings of lower egypt
conducted it safely to egypt
and found it was being done in it
the learned man then arrived in bakhtan
the god departed to his horizon
in a distant land that people do not know
the majesty of re then said
that he might answer what i had said
speak justice and do justice
one whom we name son of the north wind
millions of times
then his majesty said to one of these companions
and cold as he wishes
look she has gone saying
after one had reached the other
and his majesty saw my valour
wash yourself put water on your fingers
which were assigned
lord of abydos
the evil that scourges the earth
then this peasant proceeded to wail very loudly
he executed a royal commission
this god arrived in bakhtan at the end of one year and five months
and didnt fight
to you belongs gold
the kings mother ordered that to you be made a cenotaph
his father re is his protection
and my name was not heard from the mouth of a herald
to be made to a cake
for the division of plots of land
because his father amun loved him so much
the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperkare gave me
beginning of the teaching made by the leader of nobility foremost of action made by a man for his son
which my noble father amun lord of the thrones of the two lands has given to me
when will ruddjedet give birth
then my body will become young again
different kinds of fruit
and love to one who doesnt forget him
then he gave it to the caretaker and said to him
behold i will take away thy ass peasant
the influence of a goddess
that they may rush like a bodys shadow
my titulary was established as
he created it as his monument
hearing is good for the hearer
and from a new papyrus roll he had every petition read out
of my father cheops justified
whose lord has entered his reflections
who smashes the heads of the evil minded
this goddess returned after she had slain mankind in the desert
with awareness of what happened to you before
the king of upper and lower egypt kheperkare
then meskhenet approach him
the harbour is flooded
go to elephantine
usermare sotpenre
a commoner asks for dinner
who were brought as prisoners
horus mighty bull beloved of maat
foremost of karnak
no equal to him has been found warrior hero on the battlefield
without him giving anything thereof to his own house
in his neck
given life stability dominion and health
i have given you all life and dominion
performing the rites for his father amun re
then i brought booty from there
priest of horus and pakhet
so this god spent three years and nine months in bakhtan
the princes of every foreign land came bowing in peace
the southern land to the palace l.p.h.
you will make it into a porridge
there is no yesterday for the negligent
i showed valour on foot in his majestys presence
and djedi said
now he is a god without equal
hail to you re of the nine bows
while every asiatic was shouting
the good god who seizes with his arm
now he is a hero who acts with his own arm
follow your heart as long as you live
and what one city had taken from another
is it done this to me
who is driven from his border is truly a coward
for this lid of this sarcophagus
of good limestone
which was there by the millions
who will disrespect your plans
may they give
bronze
do not speak falsehood for you are the balance
words to be spoken
because he trusted me
he then awoke in fear
the priest says the spell for him
fowl
do justice to me
examinor of mankind
absolutely everything
brothers are evil
usermare sotpenre
who was well disposed to those who had nothing
he established his border to the crest of the world
look the boat is on the ground
so they are good too for burial
spreading them out under your feet throughout their lands
it was difficult in the opinion of the people who were dragging great things on it
when this peasant had said these words
is it suffering
the people who were in egypt
330 princes each one thereof with his army
precious wood comes for me from kush
he recognized that i was one who did what he praised
and tows the transport
the one in gods booth
his majesty sailed on this canal
lord of busiris
this is much against me today
and very many soldiers and horses
grand vizier
a great lump of incense

seeing the monuments of their lords
given life stability dominion and
his majesty sailed northward
dug out was its lake
how well it goes for him with this advice in his heart every day
the crew of re is driving in their mooring post
now the house of this nemtinakht was at a waterside path
my name reeks through you
to adore him
kissing the ground for the foremost of those in the west
richest of the rich
that his majesty did continuously
horus lord of the two lands is victorious
in speaking do not take sides
he is a brave bull
i ascended there as one who is justified
which adorns the two lands through its beauty
when he had reached djedi
he is mighty of arm
look justice is fleeing from you
do not have sex with a child woman
it descended safely
i was one who was firm
creatures from the hills came down to him
how is it djedi that i havent been made to see you before
when i reached the harbour of this city
o eldest god in whom i came into being
it will tread grain for its offence
while he was on his chariot
gold horus living of birth
royal seal keeper
may suffering be driven away from the people
but if you shut your eyes to the impudent
a pellet of incense is to be put in it unbroken
who makes the land verdant more than a great nile flood
you have lost virility
to the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt snofru
as is his daily custom
no equal to him exists among the brave of all lands together
or that makes him a friend
may isdes defend me in the sacred hall
and drink as i please
are you a thief then
or any poor man
you were appointed to hear cases
i have given you all flat lands and all mountainous lands
in joy
this god is here with us whereas he should go back to egypt
and their possessions as well
leader of overseers
i was in the favour of the king until
even a father can have his plenty of grief
he is more effective than a million of numerous soldiers
it is self seeking
gold horus great of strength rich in power
that they will give you praise as a god
beer
on account of the wickedness of what was done to him
to startle you
and the myrrh terraces unknown to egyptians
here is a beer that is sweeter than the taste of honey
then i made a capture and carried off a hand
my name reeks through you
electrum
since i had taken their horses
merciless to the enemy who attacks him
year 50 first month of the season of harvest day 22
two ladies who establishes laws who pacifies the two lands
that he might perpetuate his name forever
because i am very skilled in strength and victory
whose hands i joined together for you in victory
one day
for whom this land has love
brave shepherd
more than the smell of ducks
who are in upper egypt and elephantine
which it had hidden from other kings
if you heed these things that i have told you
then i conveyed the king of upper and lower egypt djeserkare justified
he crosses over to this city his daughter with him
that one came to say to his majesty
i adorned his great barque for all eternity
when the ostrich dances in the valleys
all many priests
like the smell of lotus flowers
then i went to report this
put into effect the rule i have drawn up
the bedouin carrying their gifts
and had brought osiris
may you let a divine sacrifice be made to the gods
but he fled from his majesty to another land
before they had lived
to seek out him who had rebelled against him in that land
that he might perpetuate his name forever
give instruction as
my name reeks through you
i will heap up hay
says
while i have many servants
their tails behind him
door keeper of the tempel and priest
the fourth time already of pleading with you
in the fortress slayer of the foreigners
nephthys behind her and heqet was hastening the birth
the hill was turned into water
and customs houses were established on the river
may they take as much myrrh as they wish
to the western border
and khons the provider in thebes went
and his belly is to be rubbed in
heaven and all foreign lands created by the god are completely subservient to her
is the stand balance biased
so act accordingly
on the hills of the gods land
at what i had said
a vessel of gold
seal keeper of all that is sealed in the temple of amun
in this form
there was kneading and straining beside me
then the high steward rensi son of meru sent a message
except for the jars
to what will happen
on that day of great combat
we come and let his children after him prosper
he loads his harvest into a boat
not seen not beheld
charged as tributes of the annual requirements
pitching camp of the envoy of the king and his expedition
this flight that the servant made
a director of heart who is superior to you
that he made my majesty bring
that you be remembered
i did it and you advanced me
he travelled north on it his heart being glad having slain his enemies
it devours the aegean islanders with its flame
together with an expedition of ten thousand men
servant of min in the foundation ceremonies
o eldest god in whom i came into being
the ends in the void of horus
it is a sacred region of the gods land
behold thou art a city without a ruler
saying
while your heart is glad
it makes easy prey of the evil minded
the overseer of works suti
until the moment that he returns to his house
they give praise to the lord of the gods amun re
one who wrongs his confidant for his client
foremost of those in the west
that my mother proceeded to become regentess and countess
who attained the boundaries of the foreign lands
i will take you
with millions under his guidance
is acting corruptly thereby
she went on to bestow on me another favour
his heart has acted according to his set steps
of the sovereign in the lands of the bedouin
in addition to the catch of my hounds
to bring him back
given life forever until eternity
but who has become a pattern for the criminal
who judges without being partial
whom valor was given while he was in the egg
who conferred on me all foreigners
for you block our path with your clothes
these women
to expel the influence of a god
and drunk with your beer
a royal offering of horus of edfu
but the one mighty of strength overthrew them
a man from the delta in taseti
beginning of the teaching made by the leader of nobility foremost of action made by a man for his son
nor do you give me a reward for this good speech
because of punishing the evil of one who does it
at landing
whats with him there
and i am near to passing away
he created it as his monument for his father amun re
for the life prosperity and health of the king of upper and lower egypt
all foreign lands were united standing prepared to fight as one
his beloved
none is content there
molester of the entire land
and the same was done for the whole crew
i decked the god with his weapons
a mans heart is his life prosperity and health
foremost in the house of his lord
then i said to her
you cannot fear him who submits it to you
my waters do not know the great favour from the king
then they rowed back and forth
then he will pass it
to give praise according to my appointment
in the presence of the mistress of byblos
so that he will feel well immediately
the man who made it
there was no discontented face in hermopolis
left on a hill
then meskhenet approach him
for 4 days
whom can i talk to today
which was wrong to his heart
galena
given life stability and dominion like re forever
my arms bent before him

the man who sleeps till dawn is the lord of a multitude
im laden with misery
leader of entire upper egypt
leader of the door of upper egypt
in order to see the face of my lord
precious wood comes for me from kush
put whining on a peg
wealth does not indeed come of itself
foremost of those in the west
then they entered towards ruddjedet
the appeaser is causing misery
life is yours
they have conspired against me
from great to small
expelled from its place
for there is no brute who attains excellence
the norm of the divine word
coming in peace saying
the enemy staggers because of its might
ra speaks concerning that thing
beer
he erected the upper egyptian boundary markers
those who built in granite
may you perish
as a teaching before his children
with the exception of one of these children of the ruler of vile kush
alabaster
at a command for the condition of the multitude
djeserkare
like someone in his pyramid
who is great of strength in battle
one cannot stand near him
deben of incense
and customs houses were established on the river
the officials who were appointed to eradicate falsehood
and swallowed for four days
do not raise your voice peasant
the son who excels his steps are distinguished
city of amun
without putting it
then i made my way northward
greatly feared in the mouths of the bedouin
the one who appears on the horus throne of the living
given life stability and dominion like re forever
in the evening
it makes easy prey of the evil minded
great god

which its lord had abandoned in fear
and your name is foremost among all living forever
sovereign who seized the nine bows
the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt re rose early
i conduction the great procession
children of officials from their towns
but desire to reach the west
there is no one who dares come near to your majesty
they destroyed what had been built
or the influence of anything bad
i will recount to you something similar
there came a strong man of retjenu
and weakens hands
who calmed the weeping with good words
without confusing one with another
overseer of works at the rock tomb of the king
ill go and tell this
weakness has overtaken me
a champion without equal
be favourable my soul
i said to him
painters painted in it
and his majesty said
and rub himself in
a man who worries all day long
powerful of strength
if there is a lack of it poverty takes power
my majesty hunted them a herd of 120
akh sut 19
look it is in this box
i commanded a mortuary offering
noise in the southern sky
with trustworthy advice
hidden from the troglodytes and foreigners
he is a brave king an excellent fortress to his army
in joy
a well was found in the middle of the valley
reached as far as the western lands
when he had shot his arrow there
whose plans do not fail
she gave bread to the poor man after she found him on the street of this city
may you abandon this neglect
and the governing of the two banks
whom the king of upper egypt elevated
and polished my weapons
who drives his flock
arrogant
i was a dutiful administrator of your monuments
and fashioned its cordage
for he will not be swayed for you
he is in the boat
for my need is heavy
he is bast she who protects the two lands
to be made to a cake
trees fall
he let me smite all foreigners
until she arrived at this august mountain
and they couldnt go out for fear of the bull
without equal
the heart of your majesty will be gladdened by seeing them row a trip back and forth
greatest of the companions
because of the greatness of the might of her father amun
more than any king who lived since the primeval time of the land
furthermore provide sustenance for this peasant himself
more accurate than a plummet
wereret mistress of punt
a rod that makes waters accessible that have stayed behind during low tide
ruler of egypt
gold horus divine of appearance
there is no cow that can be tied to the wall
he made me the ruler of a tribe
who made the sacrifice to his son
a thousand of bread
kings mother
you will let the provisions be given to him
son of re sesostris
but if you restrain me from a death
beloved of the king
you will not find a place on which you can rest in the west
i came to let you crush the aegean islanders
he crossed the euphrates after him who had attacked him as chief of his army
this is three times to induce him to act
that his majesty did continuously
lord of the crown
making the lower chapel for myself
of silver gold lapis lazuli black copper
in a jar
to rule his city
first time of the hebset festival
then this matter was recounted
my majesty hunted them a herd of 120
fight against opening up the bonds on you
they are subservient to me as one
have you come to kiss this child
but this nemtinakht then said
not a donkey died
the cabinet of the palace assembled
from the crest of the world
and also my god nun
that we may report to their father who let us come
i let your power pervade all lands
spreading them out under your feet throughout their lands
i am free from exaggeration
my neglectful brother
and trampled the towns on its banks
none of them offered resistance
his beloved wife iuri

it are the fishermen of elephantine who will dig out this canal every year
look i shall take away your donkey peasant
and my staff was of ebony decorated with electrum
death is in my sight today
by sailing north or by land
concerning every office that he held
and the fields were flooded three palms high with the liquid
in the residence of this city
leader of the temples of the red crown
their districts were massacred
your light opens the eyes of the flock
while he has pain
khons in thebes neferhotep
and ties your things to their proper place
i was a confidant of the king in each of his offices
who establishes offices like the beautiful of face
as there is no one who escapes his arrow
of millions and hundreds of thousands of miles
but your name still lives
the temples are celebrating
and turn into worms
leader of the temples of the red crown
and my arrow was stuck in his neck
and is throwing me on the fire to burn me up
a pillar has fallen in the water
when i came to her
begotten by kamutef
of green gold from amu
there is nothing that is not on it
i opened my mouth to my soul
given life stability dominion and
son of re of his body tuthmosis ruler of truth

the shoulder is not injured by being exposed
pain leaves a swelling pain leaves a swelling
and passing to blessedness
ineni

the pronouncement of the king himself
the house of the scribe

two ladies enduring of kingship like re in heaven
as you will not be turned back at the difficult place
he appointed him to be prince regent count
is what makes a moaner turn into an active opponent
and all kinds of riches
and subjugated naharina
bakhtan is your home
he is eager when he attacks the easterners
who established his two lands
but he cant hear her
all required equipment to be put in a tomb shaft was supplied therein
it is pleasant that the gods should eliminate the concealment of my body
abound with all good products of the wadi natrun
i was one who was kind
of the lord of eternity
i captured their inhabitants for egypt
like the smell of lotus flowers
my speech is done
he is alive by it
listen to my speech
i brought him a sarcophagus
it is his power that fights for him
with a beautiful bearing while walking
the royal seal keeper
as you live for me
his daughter saw him
do not put one thing in place of another
then his majesty smote that nubian nomad
who took possession of the two lands
because heads have fallen in the water
his intimate before the courtiers
jubilation is throughout the entire land
count
and be trustworthy
a sure marksman
given life like re forever

a troop of warriors of unet arriving in peace
reception of the tribute of a prince of punt

and of the gods and goddesses
i succoured the widow without a husband
and his belly is stiff because of it

then i was cast on an island
which was put in another chest
royal linen white cloth fine linen moringa oil
for it is mighty
he conferred on me the foreign lands of retjenu
for obstructed are going by night travelling by day
before his majesty
for his father amun lord of the thrones of the two lands

new quarries were opened up
when he is buried
there is none silent whom you let speak
he has made me lord of the five portions
who made the plan for the masses
then my majesty ordered that they be granted passage
lord of silence may you give me back my things
acolytes
and his majesty ordered him to go to bakhtan with this messenger
overlord of the land to its limit
with royal gifts
begotten by the priest seneb
making a man sad
a master of goods what is he like

and his majesty ordered him to go to bakhtan with this messenger
ready of tongue
and mercy has left you
which is from cedar from conquests of my majesty

two ladies living of birth
and warms all who are chilled
that day
there was no limit to all kinds of cattle
without him suffering therein
two ladies great of terror

for the word has taught since the time of ra
said by the man of the elite foremost of arm
every scribe

and adorn my chest with a collar
but the weary of heart does not hear their cries
but without letting a ship of the nubians pass

and deliver ruddjedet of the three children who are in her womb
who leaned on a child
but he cant hear her
there were two observers
from the two lands of fenkhu
given life
it measured the width of a loincloth
then the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt re came
have you come to hurt him
i never acted appalingly on a mission of the king
never happened the like to servants whom their lords had praised
this foreign land was made subject to his majesty
the bedouin of asia in ivory and ebony
i crossed in a boat without a rudder
his children will not be devotees
but it does not make one tired
now i have spoken out against the aggressor
my daughter is in the house
sent a message to the residence to let them know
i was one who took care of the hungry who had nothing
my father was a soldier of the king of upper and lower egypt
without an old age of coughing
and you are still robbing
embracing the shadows

it is a turning point of life
then the pavilion was prepared with every good thing
during this that khons the provider in thebes and the spirit did
true favourite of his lady
they are to be massacred by the butchers
more than a covert of reeds full of fowl
inscribed with my own name
fenugreek
when vile kush was overthrown
you have thought of the day of burial
so did for him son of re amenophis may he live forever
and has rebelled against all that is said

king of upper egypt in buto

breath of the mouth is beneficial to the blessed
than those of the ancestors built before me
if there good cases arise from the one who is the superior
like iah among the stars
all wood is splintered like a papyrus reed
for you have been brought up as a pupil of my majesty
who will be excellent in the hearts of the officials
and the ruler of eternity
which bore his beauty
concerned himself with it
the womb puts her in her arms
the great god who expels disease demons

you are taken away from leaping around
any scribe
the influence of a dead man or dead woman
and she said to me i prefer my own thing to its substitute
was let to ascend to heaven
considerateness extends friendship
the daughter spoke to her father when she saw the sevant upon his donkey
another theme to guide your hearts
when you were a young man of twenty six years
you are alive
within two months
beloved of the king
like the skys clearing
of the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperkare

the majesty of the palace l.p.h. beseeched the stairs of the lord of the gods
after he had loaded his donkeys
who shuns evil

whom the lady of the two lands advanced
the two lands
he lets falsehood be an abomination
this goddess returned after she had slain mankind in the desert
i created it for myself to gladden my heart
he crossed the euphrates after him who had attacked him as chief of his army
that he flees on the day of suffering
and i hurried
so that the current ones were numerous
who have gone to others beside them
and justice will be neither insufficient nor excessive
will you then not allow us to pass on the path
sem priest controller of the kilted
two ladies shining as a flame great of strength
give praise to my image
the one who waters mischief to make deception grow

good lord i report to you concerning the daughter of the prince of bakhtan

chief of the roads
who rises in the morning
you should say what you know how to explain
molester of the entire land
which i built for it to be shade for my soul
when you are dead
as to this grave
he sees wisdom as ignorance
you will never die in a foreign land
who smashes the heads of the evil minded
create shelter so that your shore will be safe
he placed me at the head of his children
and placed the gifts that the prince of bakhtan had given him of every good thing
who kept his name alive
then isis placed herself before her
to whom great ones come while they are bowing
who fills my temple with remembrance of her love
day 15
a block of 4 cubits by 8 cubits by 2 cubits
one lives on the breath that you give
they entered megiddo
of proceeding to revered status
for the division of plots of land
this is the prayer of this humble servant to his lord
without there being anyone to protect them
effective of being
concerned himself with it
prince turi
my limbs failed
i said to him
then he came at me while i waited
whom can i talk to today
his majesty appointed me scribe of the cadaster and his majesty showed me great favour
i came to let you crush those on the turtle backs
he is horus with a powerful arm a excellent fortress to his army
this god is here with us whereas he should go back to egypt
give your advice in the council of your master
all protection and life with him
what the nile brings from its source
he sees me as you are doing when you open

your ship will not lag
the princess ahmose
letting it know its boundary
and i induced cheers in the western deserts
gold horus sacred of appearance mighty of strength
and i will find him

he will stay close to me on the day of suffering
and it acquired all kinds of things

that day
foremost in the house of his lord
mistress of happiness
that this decree of the king is brought to you
high steward

you will embrace your children
when his majesty reached naharina
and they came in peace to karnak
he who comes from the darkness
city mayor
that saves me from death
who treads its ends with victorious strength
and build his monuments
and it has no way out from him
he did more for me than others before
he killed 120 elephants in the foreign country of niya
or in these members of mine
four necklaces
may your majesty send a learned man to see her
beloved of his city
my very many wonders are for you
natron
basket have you not gone too far
but this peasant said
and i bound them for you
may he give a mortuary offering
and this nemtinakht said
look you are a ferryman who ferries across anyone who has the fare
on his ... th victorious campaign
if it is a stand balance
and all good products of this foreign land
if you take it away for filling its mouth with a wisp of barley
my brother
valuables from the treasury
and kings who had been before
for this heart of mine is in joy because of seeing you
my majesty ordered the creation of the great ennead
nebipw sesostris
he perpetuated the name of his cabinet
then my majesty ordered that they be granted passage
then his majesty let
let him not speak ill of you before you have heard
fowl
then my majesty erected my stela on that mountain of naharina
who devotes himself to the royal commission
plumb line that carries the weight
to the great barque with five boats a chariot and many horses on the right and left
in this flesh of mine
with tributes on their backs
i followed kings of upper egypt and kings of lower egypt
whom the kings of upper and lower egypt have served
and the same was done to it
they didnt let their men live
and this child rushed into her arms a baby of one cubit
this house
to the cabinet
it was as a dreaming state
the high steward rensi son of meru
by means of the west wind
the king of upper and lower egypt khakaure
who acted justly as you wished
and he had entirely annihilated it
and i will let his majesty go to bakhtan to save the daughter of the prince of bakhtan
that he might answer what i had said
may you not stay dark in her womb in this name of yours of keku
fine words are more sought after than greenstone
but this peasant swore an oath
a phyle of priests from unet coming in peace
incense was put on the fire
for four days
i will drink water at the watering place
preserve the monuments of my majesty
i had defeated
in the city before the council of the entire land
ignoramus look you are questioned
we will not again do evil against menkheperre
come with them to the palace
look i am in your hands
avoid the instant of sloth
you were built for festivity
this is the road of thoth to the house of maet
and every land was bowing to his might
and her gaze was pleased by it
were shouting praises
given life forever
are giving gifts to you
one constructs there for the palace l.p.h.
on which one may rely
treasurer baqet
took his donkeys away and drove them to his district
i will not let their men live
who appeared as king of upper and lower egypt
who will pass this tomb chapel
the nose is blocked and cannot breathe
in joy
the one he favours will be a lord of offerings
at the monthly festival
to do for him his hearts desire
when he rises as harakhti
then these gods were brought
i speak to you all people
beam do not tilt
i commanded you to make them
but a fine mover has his path smoothed
i spent three days alone
magistrate and commissioner of the domains
none foolish whom you educated
do as your master has said for you
there is no limit to what became mine in victory
a royal offering of osiris
i have given you all life and dominion
everytime he takes aim
your heart will be gladdened by this
who tramples all rebellious foreign lands
because of punishing the evil of one who does it
according to the land register
now my body is full of misery
now the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt cheops justified spent the day
see it is the ka that loves to listen
reached as far as the eastern land
binding flax and yarn on the terrace
upon reporting the collection
ramesse beloved of amun
low lying land
before it has come
building their sanctuaries anew
more than fattened birds
a good son
its mouth with a wisp of barley
desire me here
have a good time
according to the land register
and ignore death
he has to be silent at the words i said so
female slave taa
look i am laden with sorrow
it is not clever to open it up
and their bread offerings were glorified and confirmed in writing
how large is this house of yours
i returned following him
you are hidden from their sight
because of the difficult stone on the ground
who fills my temple with remembrance of her love
year 3 first month of the season of harvest day 22
to be crushed with honey
and they washed him after his umbilical cord had been cut
ahmose may she live
daily offerings will be made to me
with his eldest son in command
and i had gone to sea
apart from a nubian who shall come to trade in mirgissa
on which one may rely
leader of entire upper egypt
a royal commission executed by
the secret of the truth will be found
and she said i prefer my own thing to its substitute
on account of the wickedness of what was done to him
i did not desert the king on the battlefield
like when the sky becomes calm after a heavy storm
my son my beloved horus mighty bull who appears in thebes
she is ferried across
speak to us that we may hear it
at every season
be tender hearted so that you will learn justice
`would that we might see him
a master of character who is master of wealth
faithfulness to them assures success
beloved of thoth
he did something new in his mountainous land
i was distinguished in monuments
he again did for me a very brave act
is this not the proverb that people say
before it has come
and his majesty said
for my majesty sends you
of a dead man or dead woman
resist the opportunity of greed
none sleeping whom you roused
over whom nemti rejoices
chief of the two lands
without deception and without lie
although there was no reproach
son of re of his body amenophis
i will let this god stay here in bakhtan
loading of ships to a very large extent
from real cedar from lebanon
when his death comes tardily for him
their tongues were not partial
and her titulary was established as great royal wife nefrure
as he who diminished them
as he has brought himself
when the sky is hot
and it is full of all good things
as your children will last in your places
inspiring fear greatly respected
and they said to his majesty
who attacks every land with infighting
as to hear the prayer from afar
which will have become water
like a praise singer does
he placed all of the foreign lands under your two feet to grant knowledge of his great strength
and every craft according to its nature
and your environment is corrupt
together with everyone in bakhtan
inspiring terror
a case does not arise out of the midst of praises
he said it to him after sitting upon his great throne
you say
may this humble servant be ordered to appoint a staff of old age
to be made to dough
as the daughter of the ruler of ma hedi
the city was gathered rejoicing
lord of joy
another remedy for making urine come out
every year
then he bent his head down
when his majesty arrived back in egypt
he who should give breath is suffocating on the ground
this humble servant will entrust his chicks
lord of abydos
perfecting everything that my lord had ordered
decree from the kings mother to the prince regent
if she is wayward
and the great kings wife tiy may she live
who subjugates the lands at the ends of the world
and a pedestal of silver
i was one who was correct like a balance
then his majesty said to khons in thebes neferhotep
live
son of re of his body his beloved lord of the two lands sesostris
as soon as the commoner has gone into the pool
all protection for life with him
unet is celebrating
and this peasant said
like a scale
only king raised by sopdu
my soul opened his mouth to me
thinking it was done to punish him
the majesty of this god then said
who makes them live
my lord has come to tjeret
horus mighty bull appearing in thebes
and the kings children shrieked as one
this is what they had come with
will have to say i snare against myself by my cleverness
as commander of his army
in every place they reached
like a mans grasping thereby
the place where he is
the influence of a feminine pain demon
there was no injury to an artisan
self made
of those who attacked him
now ubainer was to remain
any commoner
born of a counts daughter
the one he favours will be a lord of offerings
this is my due from you
one armlet
happiness
i have given you all life and dominion
then his majesty said
he got to know my excellence before his friends
to make his complaint
have attached your necks
of resin incense and galena
the foreign land extracts for me everything good that is in it
i opened my mouth to my soul
who created himself
like a gang without a leader
whether i am at home or in this place
ineni justified
you are the helm of the entire land
as your gods praise you
the great were as its small
the road that is walked upon
now my body is full of misery
doing it is a matter for goodness
to inspire my majestys trust
trample on evil
it measured the width of a loincloth
does not every plan succeed by it
that man is getting away from this city
because i am very skilled in strength and victory
to its entirety
son of re of his body
because he made the victories of my majesty greater
of someone whose eyes have the bjdj disease
heaven and earth are flooded by incense and
that comes from her offering table at every seasonal festival of heaven
seizing the one who speeds upon his body
he captured a rhinoceros by shooting in the southern land of taseti
who attends his lord alone
may your majesty send a learned man to see her
a fugitive flees because of his environment
so that i shall live on it
who rises in the sky formed as re
you should not do
to one who would tell me his concern
on which a god lives
a joyful woman known to her town
justified
i set the dread of your majesty in their hearts
i will not let you take him from me
the west gives me pleasure
with precious goods from the land of punt
of tjsps wood and xsyt wood
a thousand of offerings
then the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt cheops justified said
saying
and the arms of my majesty are raised warding off evil
he is more effective than a million of numerous soldiers
she who will make
he divided the great river along its middle
and created magical protection for the daughter of the prince of bakhtan
which my noble father amun lord of the thrones of the two lands has given to me
tp aqw=k m xprt n=k make your staff happy with what has come to you
after i had evaded his weapons
why have you come here
it is they who find what one lives on
then isis placed herself before her
seven thousand jars of beer were made
the hidden beast intrudes and then there is resistance
it is his serpent diadem that overthrows them for him
your father is eating bread
who eradicates them
be favourable my soul
i was distinguished in monuments
then my majesty erected my stela on that mountain of naharina
and every heart was sorry for me
the king of upper and lower egypt maatkare who creates beautiful monuments for me
overseer of all that is sealed in the temple of amun
his first wife
and all of its trees were planted anew
when you awake early to rise in the morning
thief robber snatcher
the first time the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperkare bestowed on me another favour
he said high steward my lord
how well it goes for him with this advice in his heart every day
from khons in thebes neferhotep
clothing
beware of doing evil
my heart lives for your sake
who takes care of egypt
and his majesty carried out a large massacre among them
and your provisions in the storehouse
after you have placed two bowls on the fire
who immediately overpowers all foreign lands
and the high steward rensi son of meru had
may he live forever
and the arms of my majesty are raised warding off evil
and fashioned the cabin
royal confidant amenemhet
it was reported to me
if you see a man
as done for a chief companion
while the king is in the stateroom
now that one has come to this humble servant
but why do you not hear
the great god who expels disease demons
and their shrines were made anew
then it is washed
travelling and returning safely
that malabathrum that you said would be brought
its water its fields its tamarisks and its sand
the 12th hour of the day
the one called an heir is the one who does favour
a man runs because of the lack of someone to send
words by amun lord of the thrones of the two lands
of osiris
and lead an expedition on water and on land
may he live forever
as you rejoice in the king forever
since i didnt intend to become involved in contention
overseer of all works of the palace
all the gods of upper and lower egypt
and imploring life from him
the disease of the man is to be spat on
his majesty commanded the erection of this stela
he is more effective than a million of numerous soldiers
trees were breaking the earth was trembling
i saw the great works that he built in karnak
from the palace three or four times a day
with which i could rob the goods of this peasant
and the goodness of what he does for it
he said he would fight with me
the younger sister of queen nefrure
for the spirit of
may your majesty proceed and may you see the wonder
i was one who was liked in the house of his lord
the goose was placed at the west side of the audience hall
horus mighty bull appearing in truth
etc
they were in the valley of qina
lord of the crowns
it is the lone man that the god fosters
splendid place since the time of osiris
remember my titulary
any instance except for results
beloved of month lord of thebes who lives in armant
because he loved justice so much
then her neck was cut
khepri who tires himself with labour
to the great barque with five boats a chariot and many horses on the right and left
like a mans longing to see home
copy of the decree brought to this humble servant
a constriction of urine
i am a possessor of beauty
those who will be
when you have known lesser men before
my mace overthrew the asiatics
and reusre will give them compensation for it after he returns
like a possessor of wealth
to reach the smeller with its retort
in his 2nd position
ahmose given life forever
two rings of gold
with fat bulls and fat cows
carry it to the place of which she had said i will slay mankind there
ruler of eternity
if he doesnt pass it as worms
if you do this
and the northerners come bowing to my might
who sent my majesty to seize the lands and all foreigners together
then this peasant came
foremost of those in the west
a pregnant gazelle came
the regentess
these things you say who is she this ruddjedet
as khons the provider in thebes had commanded
the king of upper and lower egypt nebtawire
founded for all eternity
she has no enemies among the southerners
in order to satisfy his spirit
at her going out into the daylight in order to see her house
it is not known what brought me to this land
look you are a town without a mayor
month lord of thebes
my father built for himself a mortuary chapel in mer neferet
djehuti hotep revered
he listens
and lay it out for me
but look what you are doing is supporting the thief
and let him speak to me
because of letting its choice offerings be given
to whom the authorities listen
and live like re forever
while he let egypt be in its state
the foreign land extracts for me everything good that is in it
which the lord of the gods the lord of armant did for him
ready of tongue
which his majesty made for himself on the west side of the city
seeing the monuments of their lords
by soldiers of old
i will not let you kiss him
their corpses
that woman whose brother is a scribe
in an hour at the time of breakfast
and earth envelops him
on the festive day of coronation
with the favour of the king lasting and enduring
then this peasant said to this wife of his
and unseen by the bearers of the two ladies
my legs have ceased to walk
one ox and a hundred bundles of vegetables
i seized its cattle
look my soul is disobeying me
a 4 nw the 4th door
prince hordedef entered
the bank is steep and the ways are under barley
he tells on to the children
a royal offering of horus of edfu
gold horus justified
a burial at the west
who can be ferried across
overseer of the granaries of amun
to whose burial a survivor has attended
have you come to cause silence
my plea is long and the division is difficult
the place where you are
who gives life
re has put the fear of you throughout the land
then it is washed
and the king of upper and lower egypt
you will be praising this after years
it happened in year 15 second month of the season of harvest day 22
he is the one who brightens the two lands more than the sun disk
who lets two men go out
the lid of this sarcophagus descended
do not vent your heart on him by his wretchedness
trees fall
then the high steward rensi son of meru gave provisions
in the necropolis
it is great it is enduring
praise is given and the god is thanked
he placed my might in upper retjenu
and the best of his staff
one side of it
is bound together under my feet
keeper of all precious stones
son of re tuthmosis beautiful of appearance
for lack of a survivor
wadjkheperre
amenhotep god and ruler of thebes
a protector who does not fear the rapacious
and mankind and gods were still united
mortuary priests and lector priests are at their duty
justified
he created you by the righteousness of his heart
the chamberlain sobekdjedju
all foreign lands in his grasp
at the necropolis
who eases pain
whom can i talk to today
governors were appointed to judge
with ointment of white fronted goose
it comes out on his doing the heart restraining him
he said
king of kings in all lands
i brought to them their offerings
and all festivals of heaven and earth
every priest
and much gold from wawat
i have come to you sovereign lord
all their horses that were with them
your bodies will be well
each and every year eight ships
countless were the captives
father of the god beloved of the god
who attacks every land with infighting
and they said
ears
scribe ahmose who lives again
for which you your majesty had sent them
she appointed me to make offering to her
is it not bad for me then
just as any royal nobleman
drinking water from the watering place of the river
who will see
no equal to him has been found warrior hero on the battlefield
the mouth that calms in the entire land
you see her
the road on which it travelled was exceedingly difficult
i tied up the nine bows
great god who expels disease demons
then his majesty said
the one who fails by lusting for her
for his temples of millions of years
can a balance be crooked
rescue all who are drowning
greatly feared in the mouths of the bedouin
like a path washed by rain
his majesty didnt halt
to plead with him for a third time
redress is short but evil is long
yours is the sweet breath of the north wind
who were brought as prisoners
i conducted the procession of upwawet
then re said
and his majesty l.p.h. said to those in his retinue
to the ends of this world
for his father amun
the priest says this spell for the scribe
this is what keeps her in your house
a harp of ebony with gold and silver
as you wish that osiris is merciful to you
and this peasant was afraid
and your speech will please
his bones were of silver his flesh of gold and his hair of real lapis lazuli
more than a diligent child
i have been forseeing it for these many years
overseer of works
he is a king who fights alone
who overthrows the rebels among the bedouin
horus mighty bull beloved of maat
while his complete expedition was behind him
rejoicing over his beautiful monument
the lands of metjen trembling for fear of you
the dance of the poor will be performed
in menat khufu
for fear of being seen by
as his majesty took possession of his inheritance
create rejoicing for him at every moment
he intended to smite me
leader of the work on this statue
i followed
on the horus throne of the living
i was one who was kind without haste
and the leaders with them were learned
whoever says i snare for myself
youths from west unet coming in peace
desire me here
year 2 second month of the season of inundation day 15
and the monuments of its burial place were more excellent
yet you have become a transgressor
count
instruction of
the lady of the heavens sees the horizon every day as she is in her sacred bark
speak to us that we may hear it
after he had exercised kingship
without answering anything he says
then he said to me
because it ate my barley
by a man who is my peer
and its cargo perishes on the ground
and as he spoke i was close to a conspiracy
i was one who was generous to him who depended on me
male slave qenpakheqa
i will cause him to become acquainted with thy greatness
with effective counsel
it is unknown why this happened
high steward kares
the archer neferenii
my name reeks through you
i am not his companion
perish in a pond surrounded at night by crocodiles
and double doors of five cubits and two palms
my favours from the king
all health and all valour and strength
then this priest said
praise the king within your bodies
i build it in the necropolis of abydos
her head is covered with the kingship of the land
given life stability and dominion like re forever
a monument built by his brother
and see what is done there
look you are the same
i was one who was composed
during the first expedition
in the tree garden around my temple
the good god lord of the two lands aakheperkare given life
they are subservient to me as one
when you knew the approach to the water of its chest
and the falcon flew off with his followers
with precious goods from the land of punt
i am a blessed to whom one should listen
and northerners are going south
in her turmoil a canal is made for her
there can be no excess of rectitude
to cover their tombs in the necropolis
in accordance with everything that his majesty had ordered
an old document
the priest says this spell for the scribe
i followed
he left the land through terror of you
words to be spoken
given life like re eternally
and my heart was advanced more than the forefathers before me
i let arrows pass by him
and know their waters according to what was in writing
the viziers house was nice
may you give offerings upon a brazier
pillar of upper egypt in the palace
on the advice of his tribe
beware of eating the adu-fish
it that-of-thirty cubits
i opened my mouth to my soul
do not make a loss on what is said
usermare sotpenre
under whose supervision the two silver houses are
a district overseer who should restrain robbery
and these were brought from there to your fathers the kings of lower egypt
something useful to whoever heeds
the king of upper and lower egypt maatkare who creates beautiful monuments for me
shall i now be robbed in his district
beloved of his lord
my character was very pleasing to his heart
knowing my vigilance
coming in and going out by day with the ancestors
to whom the southeners the northerners the easterners and westerners come
to repel the rebellious lands
whom can i talk to today
it lies light on their hearts
and who is not touched by the gruesomeness thereof
doing justice is breath for the nose
but who is there is a god who lives
overseer of the two silver houses
so that we may hear it
then his majesty said
god ruler of heliopolis
done under the supervision of the prince regent and count
who will come
and said high steward my lord greatest of the great
two women and a hand
the west gives me pleasure
look you are a man who learned something beneficial
he placed me in front of his children
he is her father
greatly to the disgust of the assessors
ruler of what the sun revolves around
pointed me
endowed with property forever
is a god ignorant of what he has ordained
ahmose nofret iry may she live forever
the lady of the land is a mother to everyone
is what is on your mind of greater concern to you
that sails north past abu sir forever
he appointed me as chief of construction in order that i might build great monuments for him
concerning his just cause
your spirit will let me reach the end
the king of upper and lower egypt nebtawire
his bones were strong his limbs were destined to be of gold
he ordered it to me against all foreigners
to have this sleeping potion poured out
then this nemtinakht said
may he live forever
of proceeding to revered status
it is to be rubbed in
i was one who knew for him who knew not
a thousand of bread
you can find it to be so for eternity
i will not let you put silence into him
go down to him and let him know your name
in the milk of
i let the aggressors who come near you become weak
like sitting under a sail
welcome in peace
and khnum was with them carrying luggage
to complain to
the only one of his kind
the good god who seizes with his arm
i was happy
and ancestor gods
he is more devouring in his moment than fire
of bread
and the council of the residence
then he said to me
a royal offering of osiris
tell me what you would do about it
count
gold horus sacred of appearance mighty of strength
who brought it on the course of restoration
while egypt is humble
for the shrine of the august chamber
then he said his magic spell
who eats five hundred loaves of bread a shoulder of beef for meat
so that they may illumine the river
then his majesty acted against it
they entered megiddo
until his urine comes out
it cannot cross in a ferry
for shelter has vanished from the harbour of the entire land
may your tongue be truthful
who keeps his name alive
his beloved
then it is not crooked
the spoken word is more persistent than weed
they made me second priest of shau of the altar
and it has no way out from him
you rewarded me on earth in karnak
pondweed
she put it in a room containing her belongings
not considering the northern lands
an intimate friend is lacking
great in braziers pure of choice meat
i was not full of resentments towards the great ones in the palace
it is his power that fights for him
your servant is in a state of joy on account of your words
given life forever
when the face is turned back to you after a storm
as your children will last in your places
of bread beer oxen and fowl
so that he will feel well immediately
you are ra lord of the heavens
while i was in your following
then he payed tribute to his majesty
half a litre of beer and three loaves of bread
as the majesty of the palace
to be repeated by putting it
wild carrot
while all foreign lands were assembled
foremost of those in the west
but there is no field for ploughing that creates itself
that his heart desires
that is a resting place
electrum doesnt match your splendour
and may your verdict be accounced
start of work at this mountain
in this body of mine
who harpoons hippopotami shoots wild bulls
since the god of those who had received the white crown
year 50 first month of the season of harvest day 22
his wife pleads with him
and he went up higher
this scribes hands are in the water but his feet are on the ground
the man is in the house
ignoramus look you are questioned
your fame has pervaded the crest of the world
the princes of every foreign land came bowing in peace
nacklaces of real lapis lazuli
with this i became great
for the division of plots of land
or the season of inundation
and you have not been negligent in the presence of officials
or does he know what the situation is
the villain is an intimate friend
in valour and strength
then this peasant left for egypt
great kings wife
is my upper egyptian barley to be a path for you
his boat cannot moor in its harbour
he placed my might in upper retjenu
bowing to your majesty as i commanded
the man who struggles with the superior is an irritant
a royal offering will be given to you
the king of upper and lower egypt aakheperenre
true son of thoth
with fearful hearts their bodies trembling
his daughter satwosret
my monuments within this city were greater that those of my forefathers
every land from which i returned
my majesty subjugated every land
although i was not spat on
as it is good to listen to people
you are hidden from their sight
the majesty of
then isis placed herself before her
with millions under his guidance
two ladies who seized all lands
i will let this god stay here in bakhtan
now another victory that re commanded for me
his majesty ordered the rebuilding of this temple again after his finding it in ruins
to gladden my heart among them
and the next morning i reached peten
that the braided in heliopolis grind this haematite
of the foremost of those in the west
its youths are refreshed
the one who had ordered this victory
to build a monument for his father osiris
brightly plumed
your sarcophagus will be built of gold
for her labour is difficult
he spotted him going down to the shore
it is finer than anything in this land
cleanse in his life
the might of his majesty guided them
since im coming to sit in it
he came across a man standing on the embankment
and they fled immediately
those who were in egypt heard it
then the haematite was put into this beer mash
copy my form do not neglect my words
is what is on your mind of greater concern to you
i built a monument within my city
mistress of the palace
my majesty did this
as perished as those who have never been
when he goes to rest on the horizon of the sky
whoever is known as a quarreller
says
is there no road to his majesty
khnumhotep son of nehri justified and revered
its the girl who grew up in this house
the one who is with him
we cross over when the scribe sends
its one side was under water
it is taking a man from his house
i was given male and female servants
its people are your servants
and all his people as booty
horus who rejoices in truth
the god grants it to be great by your hand
whom he made great before his children
without him suffering therein
from fresh cedar from lebanon
to be ruler of his inheritance in menat khufu
prince turi
i will not let him go back to egypt
she calmed upper egypt
born of useretsat
he raised me over his nobles
while all foreign lands are under your feet
khepri distinguished of birth
ra is in another place
before it has found a way out
whom can i talk to today
day 27
this bad plan
there is no profit in things if it is stifled
at last he sits down
giving plants so that he may be given life
a son who hears is a follower of horus
without your taking care
look they have fled to the desert
he ordered that i be given
noses turn cold when he starts to rage
look i am in your hands
ineni justified
then the majesty of nun said
he who should dispel weakness is acting corruptly
the lid of this sarcophagus descended
and dismiss the west
the recruits who have been trained by their lord
their utterances concerned the praises and favours towards me
geb the ennead the small ennead
who had flown from the lord of the two lands
none ignorant whom you let know
mistress of the two lands
may he live forever our lord
then i said to her
a husband to the widow
it happened when i wasnt there
his father his mother together with all his sisters
he is the unique gift of god
your father is eating bread
overseer of the granaries of amun
after i had seen that you had an excellent character
we are happy
i was placed before those who had been before me
nofret iry may she live prosper and be healthy
with a golden rim
and it happened that i placed myself on my belly
and i slept in a hammock of net
overseer of the administration
while the kings children were giving me their hands
given life stability and dominion like re forever
look you are in the house
when his back is turned
one steals
hearing my name
do not seize the sight
look you are a herdsman
and the high steward rensi son of meru sent two guards to fetch nemtinakht
in whose belly urine is constricted
an eternal memorial
may she enfold your head
and i was given the captives for slaves
while his forefathers are celebrating
it is the god who makes him excellent
for the limbs of the god
before i have come to it
high steward my lord great one lord of the great
and female singers and dancers
may khons defend me a true scribe
and one turns to a stranger
makes everyone laugh by his evil wrongdoing
without fault with people
his house which is in the city along with his estate in the country
in the presence of the mistress of byblos
do not scheme for what has not yet come
given life stability and dominion like re forever
before i have come to it
with mothers brothers
as a sender in whom are divine limbs
the awe is in the aegean lands
i captured for him in kush
i made the ship of another descend
and had gathered its neighbouring lands
in that land of naharina
