and you will make another soul in weariness envious
i have given you millions of years
because he made the victories of my majesty greater
its people are your servants
who are dead on a riverbank
on the hills of the gods land
because he loved justice so much
and the fathers and mothers who were with me
the king of upper and lower egypt lord of the two lands lord of rituals
he cannot reach land
strong men together with invalids
a shot filled is like an oar abandoned on the ground
i gave water to the thirsty

her head averted
put whining on a peg
look you will arrange the matter with me
and falsehood will be cast on the ground
he who measures heaps of corn is pilfering for himself

the influence of a dead woman
it is resentment
and the festival hall of every god
he is like another man

his flame that drives away his enemies
since i am deliberating
who is loved by his city god

your body is fattened for you more than your contemporaries
every criminal will say
death is in my sight today
i increased awe of you in every body
and something harmful to whoever transgresses it
amun re lord of the thrones of the two lands
as a kings wife does for one she loves
horus living of birth
the lands of metjen trembling for fear of you
you do not flee
who was loyal to his benefactor
makes everyone laugh by his evil wrongdoing
after making it
there is no one who has returned from there
going with her face towards the people before her
and my accusation brought departure
hearts are greedy
and a ball of incense
and said high steward my lord greatest of the great
who is silent when one is silent
my feet hastened

list of names of the male and female slaves from the booty given to me
without there being anyone to protect them
the wag festival
you have erected my sanctuary as a work of eternity
and those that were undecorated
what my soul said to me
who should enrage a man by his ill deed
truth is an aspect of falsehood
do not pour out your heart at the man facing you
an eye that gazes at you will not fear
the king of upper and lower egypt nebukaure
he got to know the excellence of my mind
then this humble servant sailed southward

lacuna in text
1/16 water
so that he will feel well immediately
and restores mounds that have been ravaged
and swallowed for four days

which sheds its flame in fire and emits its fragrance
who eradicates them
and the entire priesthood of the temple
it is like something too great to recount
the children of the steward
amun re lord of the thrones of the two lands lord of heaven
at their every feast of the heaven and of the earth
how perfect is the issue of his mouth
a distant place in fear
you will not taste the evil of the river

then who will repel evil
how lamentable is the poor man you ruin
he was standing on the road
the fish spearer is harpooning awbbw fish
which is brought to the palace l.p.h.
all that the sun shines upon
but this nemtinakht then said

that comes forth from the mouth of re himself
consisting of every excelling deed of bravery since the beginning
the king of upper and lower egypt nebpehtire justified
it belongs to the high steward rensi son of meru
one is contented with evil
it is known
and is throwing me on the fire to burn me up
i am a well born man strong and wise
look doing something like that to the noble flock is not ordained
the one with powerful arm who tramples his enemies
that his majesty did continuously
a lion is not sent on a mission
who sees to his city for eternity
as son of a count into the inheritance
to issue a challenge in my tent
as he was made to smite the asiatics and trample the bedouin
and swallowed for four days
turned into something that one cant see
and they said to his majesty

without millions of men behind him
then the royal scribe thothemheb came before his majesty
he divided the great river along its middle
for lack of an intimate friend
one of a kind
the learned man then arrived in bakhtan
but then egypt is happy since it knows his ability
to whom upper egypt came bowing
is there another hero who could fight him
without millions of men behind him
