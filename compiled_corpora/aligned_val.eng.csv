they made me second priest of shau of the altar
with fresh myrrh trees
asia is subject to his majesty
look you are the same
begetter who creates mankind
his eyebrows were of real lapis lazuli
and who have not been opened by childbirth
before we had reached land
while you carry weapons on a chariot
his majesty shot
look you are with me as a servant
my name reeks through you
ptahwer justified
for his son nebtawire
and the air of heaven is breathed when you say so
who confronts the battlefield furiously
that is in the barn as the remainder of yesterdays barley
god punishes with the same
seeking every excellent deed
look you are a hunter who slakes his desire
in my function of initiated
1/4 dates
to be a resting place for my shade
beloved of amun
a royal offering
may he live forever
to be eaten for one day
i was like in a dreaming state
resin fat
then his majesty said
in flat lands and mountainous lands
passing a lifetime at peace
do not seize the sight
and his two plumes danced
to report to the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt cheops justified
the people who were in egypt
ornament of the mistress of the two lands
put my name in the mouth of your servants
i gave water to the thirsty
i saw construction of a magnificent ship
i made for myself this tomb it being consecrated and its place being embellished at the staircase of the great god
should be shelters from the agressor
your earnings are in the estate
that the braided in heliopolis grind this haematite
the guard on the wall who was on duty
according to the land register
djadjaemankh my brother
it is the good god
then i was assigned to rising in memphis
and man a ship with all beautiful women from inside your palace
son of re amenophis ruler of thebes
and find him
be careful that you do not run aground while at the tiller
purple nutsedge
i said to him answering him
mistress of all women
so as to cause the followers to pray for the proficiency of his arms
put his fame in others
guiding his mouth according to what he has been told
go and measure for me the barley
the vigilant leader of the lord of the two lands
you are a father to this town
kay son of nehri justified
then a star fell
what i have seen of your might
what old age does to people
and another will come
where i fought properly
to your house and see your children
who attacks every land with infighting
and clothes to the bedouin
you who should let a man attend his truly good cause
ready of tongue
which was put in another chest
the kings children who were following him
the union of the two lands
punish theft
in the land where i was born
a method that has been successful
and she said i prefer my own thing to its substitute
which were desirable to his heart
and ancestor gods
greater was my praise in the palace than that of any unique friend
in the service of the house of gold
year 3 first month of the season of harvest day 22
the revered the gods father truly beloved of his lord
she who comes from the darkness
and gathers them
he cannot reach land
and turn into worms
to the ends of this world
whom the lord of the two lands dignified
founded by horus
then my majesty erected my stela on that mountain of naharina
and warms all who are chilled
cattle too numerous to count
whom the lady of the two lands advanced
and every priest and official
while i give bread to my neighbour
this bad plan
and the next day
he created it as his monument for his father amun re
and re said
will end by being given to a stranger
searching what was beneficial to his father amun
saying
and from a new papyrus roll he had every petition read out
now they had brought their menits and their sistra
you will reach home within two months
i captured all their people
look a wonder that happened in the time of your forefather the king of upper and lower egypt snofru justified
i provided him with offering tables
when he proceeded to champion his father
his nose behind him
you do as you wish
in the kingship of the land
bowing to his uraeus
the land sails in accordance with thy commmand
no losses occurred to the evil ones
the circumstances of it are unknown
then i brought booty from there
i deprived their noses of the breath of life
while i was on my belly before him
and has assumed the inheritance of his father
born of
and he told him while he was in the body entirely
i shall recount to you something similar which happened to me myself
who lets two men go out
his son has already entered the palace
doing what is praised
this was copied from start to finish
in order to make something similar for himself for his horizon
let me carry out his many expeditions
keftiu and isy being in awe of you
royal seal keeper
i let egypt be chief
sailors being in it whom thou knowest
and all good and pure things on which a god lives
before i have come to it
has appeared as king of upper and lower egypt
as does one singularly beloved of amun
makes everyone laugh by his evil wrongdoing
kings wife and kings sister
then his majesty said to the crocodile
one was well disposed towards me in all respects
and justice was established in its place
who enters to report
so that its hem came to rest on the water
and created magical protection for the daughter of the prince of bakhtan
in which this god flourishes
the other under barley
for doing is more useful to the doer than to the one for whom it is done
and to drive off intrusion from the desert region
tarried for me
which i couldnt count
true image of love
the words of the officials follow it
one to whom the listeners listen
the oldest prince came out the supreme commander of this father
perhaps it is a peasant of his who went to someone else beside him
my plea is long and the division is difficult
may he live forever
three bracelets
they brought things the like of which had not been brought
and this peasant said
hedge plants
she is the excellent stern rope of lower egypt
may i be allowed to inform you
everyone
concerning his being brought back to egypt
anyone fully fluent in speaking
when goodness is good goodness is good indeed
for the division of plots of land
then the high steward rensi son of meru gave provisions
horus mighty bull beloved of maat
one will slaughter for you at the entrance of your tomb
then i brought away two female slaves as booty
look i am going to egypt
who cannot be turned away
and restores mounds that have been ravaged
justified rai
divine king going forth on the day of victory like month
justified
food cannot be brought to town
you will let the provisions be given to him
and every heart was sorry for me
and protector of his children
they were given to friends of his
i have provided his protection against you
uproar in the northern sky
never was anything like that brought to any king
a king who is lauded for his arms in battle
none foolish whom you educated
every son of mine who shall strengthen this boundary
i let them know the ritual of every day
on the day of the massacre by the good god
assigned to the mortuary priest
whereas my soul has not quarrelled with me before
the excellent ones and inhabitants of his house
to have this sleeping potion poured out
after you have placed two bowls on the fire
as he governs his two lands
who brought you who brought you young man
and he said high steward my lord
as is wood from egypt
its leash having fallen on the ground
and again i was given gold of valour
when he is buried
you speak at the case of closure
chief of the two lands
may you grant me old age in your city
a son that listens
and swallowed for four days
my favours from the king
there is no cow that can be tied to the wall
he of edfu great god lord of heaven
no success of theirs came about at all
and produce a son in the favour of god
your ship will not lag
horus who repeats birth
31 persea trees
scribe ahmose who lives again
subservient to him are the islands of the ocean
the sounding rod is in your hand
rudder of the earth
on the soil of thebes and tawer
then i brought two warriors as captives from the ship of aata
overseer of the granaries of amun
with strength and with might
as he sailed southward to khent hen nefer
pleading with this nemtinakht
on account of his divinity
relieve the distress
divine state
your hands upon something good
oxen
one who has nothing
content in the place of eternity
as you will pass to blessedness
one would snare for me
his daughter satsobek
whose southern borders reach to the crest of the world
then may you do evil
none of them offered resistance
he is the one who brightens the two lands more than the sun disk
i repelled those who rebel against the neshmet barque
with his heart in accord with mine
the one with powerful arm who tramples his enemies
sculpters drawers metalworkers
and argues
and they accomplish nothing when your majesty goes down
the nubian nomads from khent hen nefer
a bathroom divine images of the horizon
raised by bedouin
musicians preceding you
free from lies
leader of everything in this entire land
ahmose
his protection is at the back of the giving of his powers
so may re lord of the two lands be gracious to you
was it caused by the three children that i mentioned
and of the gods and goddesses
for shelter has vanished from the harbour of the entire land
when every saying has been brought
for my majesty sends you
that is what is overlooked in the sight of the greedy
which will have become water
in the necropolis
his lips are reliable when he is speaking
then the maid said to the people in the household
everyone has a need for you like water
he chose me from his city
i decked the chest of the lord of abydos
who creeps in
and the northerners come bowing to my might
i directed the works on the neshmet barque
excellent horus in the palace
this humble servant seeks counsel from his god
two living men and three hands
of silver two battle axes
seed may make a disputant
and to let them see your majesty as shooting star
for the revered
day 15
low lying land
he built this as his monument
the feast of the great year and the feast of the small year
sole companion
it is not an act of people
the good god sesostris
lo i was standing and i heard or as i was standing i heard
he wouldnt come at all
he is the heir of every god
his majesty didnt halt
but shy fish will come to you
the first in heaven the second on earth
while i was on my belly before him
and praised the goodness of his majesty
after i had established a household
the name of her mother is tjuia
then the caretaker threw the crocodile of wax after him into the water
without putting it
the mild man receives more respect than the strong
and despoiled his encampment
after him riding on this chariot
but not to a human sovereign l.p.h. my lord
look justice is fleeing from you
dont be heavy you havent been light
i said i do not know him
i inundated a pond
she put it in a room containing her belongings
avoid the instant of sloth
i lifted my heart and collected myself
without him knowing
before i have come to it
the son who listens to his father is good when he is a child
that you arrive safely
i instructed him child and man
may you let the oath be established
all his wisdom will last forever
for the king
bringing of every good thing from the palace l.p.h.
the like had not happened before
the demolition of a wretched heart is a difficult matter
his name was nemtinakht
and this child rushed into her arms a baby of one cubit
his majesty sailed northward
half a litre of beer and three loaves of bread
but it is a sweet breath from your entrails
beware of eating the adu-fish
his name has reached the circumference of heaven
given life stability and dominion like re forever
and found these elephants there
much feared
that they may rush like a bodys shadow
that we may live on the breath that he gives
behaviour following the command of his ka
after his majesty proceeded to overthrow upper retjenu
who drives his flock
and i overthrew all his enemies
the two lands
and their people were brought away as captives
mankind then conspired against him
is it done this to me
then they sleep as in the state of death
and all kinds of fine vegetables
i seized the southerners under the command of his spirit
for goods do not come of their own accord
and her son nebpehtire
in a brief day
and he ruled the banks of horus
how fine is this house of yours
that woman whose brother is a scribe
and trees that always carry fresh myrrh
its length being 3700 cubits and its width 600 cubits
listen to me count
look he is a god on earth

with effective counsel
beloved of atum lord of heliopolis
a good ruler who does what is beneficial to his father and all gods

horus mighty bull beloved of maat
the foreign land extracts for me everything good that is in it
the king of upper and lower egypt kheperkare

a funeral procession will be held for you
amenophis
there came a strong man to retjenu
son of iah
i kept alive the name of my father upon them
without your interment by barbarians
in writing
and of the ennead mistresses of thebes
next to it
and crossed the water carrying him
amenhotep god and ruler of thebes
he will say

a commoner cultivates his plot
words to be spoken
how joyful is this land that he rules
they advanced their hearts being bold
whoever is under his light will be great in wealth
he who is knowledgeable like re
for we have seen his might
spread awe of him every day
and placed the gifts that the prince of bakhtan had given him of every good thing
osiris nurse of the gods wife rai
to travel south therein
this nemtinakht to the officials who were with him
a mother who has given birth may be less happy than a maid
like re forever
he erected the upper egyptian boundary markers
to plead with him
for him who prays to see it come
my monuments within this city were greater that those of my forefathers
menits vessels collars
who saves from the west
to hathor mistress of punt
then his majesty said
and my heart was advanced more than the forefathers before me
it is the nourished dead who protect the one who is on earth
the shares of horus and seth
both upper and lower egypt
this peasant said to this wife of his
of what he had planned to have said
who kept his name alive
and took the crocodile of wax with him
to be prince regent count leader of the eastern lands

at the coming forth of the hm ntr priest

there was no enmity towards me
if you marry a good time girl
born of dedetnekhbet
he grasped mankind
she has no antagonists among the northerners
for whose creation the souls of heliopolis assembled
every man knows his regulations
when you were a young man of twenty six years
your fame has pervaded the crest of the world
which was embellished and kept very secret
he then awoke in fear
in an hour at the time of breakfast

it is like i am ignored
and said high steward my lord
on the day of the wag feast
surpassing what he was told before his lord

he then said to me

and their arms grew strong
the schemers of evil

then djadjaemankh said to him
o living who are on earth
