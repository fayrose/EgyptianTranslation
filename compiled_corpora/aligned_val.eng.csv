a pyramid of stone was built for me
you have regulated it
they will succumb to the knives of horus imi shenut
and said
new quarries were opened up
then he said his magic spell
officials whom he loved were in every room
they have conspired against me
embroiling official with official
as you pass on your offices to your children
one day
i set the dread of your majesty in their hearts
overseer of the two gold houses
whats this mood sovereign l.p.h. my lord
his goods have been robbed
who will pass by this monument
this is its completion from beginning to end as found in writing
and touched the ground before him
my anguish leads to separation
each and every year eight ships
it happened in year 15 second month of the season of harvest day 22
speak up when you have penetrated the case of the craftsman
with silver gold lapis lazuli turquoise
tnm plants
as for any son of mine
as commander of his army
oxen
one whom we name son of the north wind
he is atum himself nebukaure
do not rob but act against the robber
and i followed the god in his steps
it is a turning point of life
i restored their temples
so that i need not scream
he says
but what is the gain thereof to you
the things that he said
without failing
the commoner said to the wife of ubainer

who tramples all rebellious foreign lands
and she became well instantly
helmsman dont let your ship go off course
male slave qenpakheqa
aakheperkare may he live forever
ahhotep
by the might of the majesty of this god
in the season of harvest
i placed myself between two bushes
it was his majesty who opened its road
when i was in the primordial water
these women
his words are heard
going with her face towards the people before her
making for him a resting place of eternity
i touched the earth
for i have grasped all that his eye revolves around
son of re of his body tuthmosis shining like re
son of re tuthmosis beautiful of appearance
i said to him
it is parrying a thing before shooting
dont act clever friend
was anointed with fine oils
in addition to those i had presented to his majesty
if he is alive there are his arms
none downcast whom you enlivened
concerning this flight
the bank is steep and the ways are under barley
lord of the thrones of the two lands
and all their weapons
his place of everlastingness
i was one who was generous to him who depended on me
one will slaughter at the entrance of your altar
who creeps in
hearing my name
and the northern to the ends of asia
female slave wabentasachmet
and these messengers were brought immediately
a man remembers a bad thing but does not know the good therein
like a mans longing to see home
greatly feared in the mouths of the bedouin
and every costly stone as decoration
justified
he lets falsehood be an abomination
and the overseer of works hor say
there is no one who dares come near to your majesty
in the name of my majesty l.p.h.
i went around my encampment cheering saying
"little burning second month """" day 9 """""
and of those aboard none remained except myself
there is no eye that is more able than she to smite them for you
every dignity was conferred on him by the majesty of
whether they looked at the sky or looked at the land
avoid the instant of sloth
he ordered it to me against all foreigners

the kings mother ordered that to you be made a cenotaph
his fame is mighty

who should enrage a man by his ill deed
the name of the prophet and priest
lord of abydos
when the sky is hot
ssndm wood
while his majesty l.p.h. had grown old
prince regent
and washed my dirty linen
the praise of me in the palace was greater than that of any sole companion
as upwawet loves you
given life stability and dominion like re forever
great power residing in tawer
what i have seen of your might
disclosing to them the unexplored roads
to fight and conspire against my majesty
staff are fetched when there is shortage
two rings of gold
be very welcome to me in peace sweet daughter who is in my heart
but the truth returns to correct it
the commander there in charge of the border patrol
she who is in his presence
wind storms in addition to rain
and this child rushed into her arms a baby of one cubit
i put the fame of your majesty throughout the nine bows
an eye that sees you does not fear
my praise was with his courtiers
whose excellence was made by min
and he will feel well immediately
a distant place in fear
kay son of nehri justified
i erected it with columns anew
everytime he takes aim
on account of bentresh
leading all the living like re forever
sobek em saf
may they give
another favour was bestowed on me by his son
there was no limit to all kinds of its cattle
and perish
and live like re forever
select the fringes of action
followed by the princes of this foreign land
born of the kings mother seniseneb
son of re sesostris
do not be careless for you are the key
it is re who commanded it for me
gold horus who unites the two lands
and they came with their tributes
whose plans do not fail
a child of this city
provide sustenance for this peasant himself
every lector priest
and justice will be neither insufficient nor excessive
affection will be for the one who passes him
according to the land register
whom can i talk to today
that he will distance himself from my body
then he spread it out on the waterside path
and an armful of his spears came down
with vine
without deception and without lie
then this priest said
this is what they had come with
brothers are evil
it was a good land called araru
in the presence of the mistress of byblos
and their bread offerings were glorified and confirmed in writing
but who is there stands in a barque
on this stela of mine
i added to what was bequeathed to me
there he is on the road
bull stout hearted as he enters the arena
as was ordered to you on the first day
to whose burial a survivor has attended
and your speech will please
i repelled those who rebel against the neshmet barque
if the son is lazy there is still the wab priest
he will give to the one he favours
and dread of you as far as the four supports of heaven
to whom people were sent to ask for advise
then he spread it out on the waterside path
his fine boat is in the river
all life and dominion with them are at the nostrils of the strong king
beating time for the troop
she drove out its rebels
was before his majesty
who confronts the battlefield furiously
the residence was in silence
the king of upper and lower egypt lord of the two lands
as your king loves you
falling in heaps
i am not forsooth a confederate of his
horus mighty bull perfect of appearance
together with everyone in bakhtan
then he said to me
overseer of the city vizier ptahhotep
youths from west unet coming in peace
may you grant me old age in your city
guard against a man of experience saying
give your magical protection to him
give your advice in the council of your master
and vigorous soles
at new years day the opening of the year
may he fail what he came for
a son who is handsome is a hearing lord
if you sever who will join
two ladies who establishes laws who pacifies the two lands
i said i do not know him
gold horus justified
merciless to the enemy who attacks him
who is it that has brought thee
i spent the day at the edge of a field
to another man
a haul of catfish
the villain is an intimate friend
the passing of my lifetime was in peace
horus mighty bull beloved of maat
without loss to our expedition
patience is the monument of a man
and placed his eldest daughter before them praising his majesty
khnum and amun of mankind
loving myhrr
their tongues were not partial
the eldest of them will be high priest in heliopolis
the one with powerful arm who tramples his enemies
then i loaded this onto the boat
are you a thief
in fat of pintail duck
and he ruled the banks of horus
they are offered bread beer wine meat fruit
and he is remembered on account of the goodness
when he had shot his arrow there
a balance cannot be crooked
who will pass this tomb chapel
he gives life all life stability and dominion
daughter of a king and mother of a king noblewoman
the king of upper and lower egypt lord of rituals nebmaatre
from the stories of the ancestors
as the first victory
wereret mistress of punt
and you even deprive me of the lament from my mouth
now while i was stretched on my belly
ready for battle in a narrow defile
the king of upper and lower egypt nebmaatre
called pen nekhbet
whom the kings of upper and lower egypt have served
and felled all their trees and all their fruit trees
but who has become a pattern for the criminal
osiris weapon bearer of aakheperkare
my name reeks through you
on which a god lives
relying on the numerous troops
and bowed before him
the man speaks to ra
after the water has taken its toll
you attained them
i will create a breeze over your corpse
he captured a rhinoceros by shooting in the southern land of taseti
to thank the god for him
on these offerings
that will be loyal to him
and the helm is in your hand
who created himself
a thousand fowl
the fourth time already of pleading with you
a thousand of bread
my father built for himself a mortuary chapel in mer neferet
he is stout hearted when he attacks the easterners
together with these gods
the king of upper and lower egypt djeserkare
now bring me a learned man
without him suffering therein

had me hear their messages
he adorned it for eternity
and every lector priest
female slave taametju
and returned to kadesh
he travelled north on it his heart being glad having slain his enemies
from the crest of the world
it makes easy prey of the evil minded
given life like re forever and ever
now they had brought their menits and their sistra
here it is in my sight like heaven
he then awoke in fear
10 cubits by 10 cubits on its every side
the kings children as many as they were
the appeaser is causing misery
beloved of his lord
to be made to a cake
the memory of me remains in the palace
royal seal keeper
when he is seen attacking barbarians
is what is on your mind of greater concern to you
and dismisses an offence that happens
than that my servant might seize you
i have learned of a commoner who lives in djed snofru
and i will not repeat speaking
near the sea to receive the princes of this foreign land
do not inflate your mouth beside your neighbours
who shall disturb them
and the northern to the ends of asia
to see this beer
he is khnum for everybody
of silver two battle axes
two ladies shining as a flame great of strength
is he not to be rebuked
by the chamberlain intef
live
not a man perished
and have become a child of my majesty
the spoken word is more persistent than weed
of bread beer oxen and fowl
then the boat sank
hunting in any foreign land
i was one who was kind in the offices
she enriched me with property
concerning his just cause
while thoth directed the trip
his majesty ordered the creation of a lake
whose city went early in the morning to his house to praise his spirit
all protection life stability dominion and health with him
rejoicing in strength and victory
he made it something greater than itself
and my ams mace smited the nine bows
on a windy day
at the 12 monthly feasts and the 12 mid monthly feasts
thou shalt have thy former heart
but it does not make one tired
and passed in ascending and descending
the majesty of this god then said
shining as a flame great of strength
the awe is in the aegean lands
i will not let you hurt him
i restored their mortuary chapels
you have grown old
while i join the praised ones
and i will not repeat speaking

gold horus powerful of arms who drives away the nine bows
the king of upper and lower egypt menkheperre
whom this army of his majesty had brought
sehetepibre
and drinks a hundred jars of beer up to this day
i provided him with offering tables
speak to us that we may hear it
in this flesh of mine
who enters the turmoil of battle
and you will make another soul in weariness envious
unseen unheard
but if you flay him his thoughts turn to homelessness
i was one who took care of the hungry who had nothing
and a wave with it of 8 cubits
was it caused by the three children that i mentioned
the sea people hearing your battle cry
and said high steward my lord
whom can i talk to today
my provisions were from the storehouse of the palace every day
royal seal keeper
it is commissioning something from a craftsman
legible
nor did he answer this peasant

which has passed when you go down
mortuary priests and lector priests are at their duty
none sleeping whom you roused
i have given you all life and dominion
and to save yourself from all evil
he is a brave king an excellent fortress to his army
do not separate your heart from him
the man is in a state of joy upon seeing his fair daughter in his house
and restores mounds that have been ravaged
with my arms
you do not destroy
then the caretaker threw the crocodile of wax after him into the water
i came to let you crush the nubian nomads
millions of times
at the necropolis
with a ship or any herds of the nubians
then this peasant came
and letting a man attend his truly good cause
and of the ennead mistresses of thebes
on the day of measuring provisions
for the spirit of the great kings wife and kings mother
who leaned on a child
says
will never be allowed a good moment
with the favour of the king lasting and enduring
you will be happy here with me
after finding it had fallen into ruin
and to give goods to those who were loyal to him
he captured a herd of twelve wild bulls
preparing to smite the egyptians
of bread beer libation wine incense and meat offering
who makes the land verdant more than a great nile flood
that you cannot be prudent
he who should see has turned blind
ruler of the new settlements
he appointed his eldest son nekht
from the best of the foreign lands
what matters more than my corpse being buried
how well it goes for him with this advice in his heart every day
with trustworthy advice

when the pubic area is painful

bound with leather
i taught every craft that had been forgotten
as his feast is near
vizier amenemhet
one lives on the breath that you give
you know the number of chambers of the sanctuary of thoth
they came in peace safe and sound

so that his heart might be joyful
i will protect mankind against her

what can papyrus achieve on a mountain
to whom is reported what is and what is not
those who were in egypt heard it
if you heed these things that i have told you
on the day of robbery from the evil terror of the palace
to the might of his majesty from as far as the marshlands
then they sat down for a day of celebration

pain leaves a swelling pain leaves a swelling
reached as far as the eastern land
that is the night time behaviour that happens
spreading them out under your feet throughout their lands
through you every eye sees
when i reached the harbour of this city
to gladden my heart among them
for none is born wise

as he proceeded to the temple of ptah
overseer of the granaries of amun
youths stood in line
explore the routes to punt
tarried for me
whom can i talk to today
as what the arms of the good god did
the overseer of the sculptors carved in it
to create his statue for eternity
to take them away is to stop up his nose
then he gave it to the caretaker and said to him
when building his house
then this peasant said
and all things
but he cant hear her
without there being anyone to protect them
perceptive like thoth
the mother of a boy
queen and sister of the sovereign l.p.h.
oxen

while they smite his enemies for him
great god who expels disease demons
of bread
and imploring life from him
and its royal funerary chapel
there will be no rebel against you in what heaven surrounds
royal confidant amenemhet
a thousand of alabaster
to be mashed
and djedi said

i gladdened the hearts of the eastern deserts
under the majesty of

setting off on a good journey to the gods land
he said to me

to whom great ones of busiris come
i have given you all flat lands and all mountainous lands
i gave water to the thirsty
about this entire matter
consisting of hard stone
the one who fails by lusting for her
in karnak
and how egypt sails depends on what you command
and his two plumes danced
patricians give him praise
may you give offerings upon a brazier
you have delivered the poor from evil
and he doesnt look at his belly
it cannot cross in a ferry
that i built a tomb
the god who ordained this flight
then as the prince of bakhtan was asleep on his bed
the king of upper and lower egypt lord of the two lands
hear do good things
fix the produce levy according to the grain harvest
and his majesty ordered him to go to bakhtan with this messenger
debate with him after a period of time
such has never been seen in the annals of the previous kings

the bedouin of asia are subject to my majesty
and lay down your arrow
pieces of wood from farafra
everything that is
i have done as what you have said
gngnt beans
i beg your pardon i dont know the number thereof sovereign l.p.h. my lord
and the great kings wife tiy may she live
and they pleased his heart

with calm pace
after he had gone to miu

and he will be provided with a thousand loaves of bread
his daughter saw him
which was put in another chest
mysteries
clothing
but desire to reach the west
and the maid went and opened the room
and said high steward my lord
i am the one who is speaking to you
seven thousand jars of beer were made
i will let your majesty hear a wonder that happened
one swears by him in all lands
his father a wab priest of the temple of ptah
uneducated whom you instructed
and he went on to say to his majesty
beloved of his city
he intended to rob me
self made
next to it
who knows what is desired
but who is there stands in a barque
of three digits in thickness
her grave and her cenotaph are
there was kneading and straining beside me
like a mans longing to see home
and that he might adorn it for eternity in his tomb of the necropolis
respect his oath
dont be haughty in proportion to your might
look the boat is on the ground
where i fought properly
he is one who bends down horns
let the prince of bakhtan make a great offering before this spirit
arrogant
and anise
the one who acts according to what is said is the one who loves hearing
and this goddess said
he will not fail to do good to a foreign land
then they made the sky turn into storm and rain
the west is a harbour
when you set
with fresh myrrh trees
fowl
left on a hill
pen papyrus palette of thoth
djehuti hotep
next to it
consisting of every excelling deed of bravery since the beginning
and swallowed for four days
their hearts are in joy
when your self restraint has subdued his excess
and it will not happen due to him
what my soul said to me
be seated
whom he loved
which the lord of the gods the lord of armant did for him
male slave pajabdju
they say
when i heard the sound of bellowing of cattle
when he found him
and it was pleasure to my heart
a man leaves his land because of nakedness
or who will mutilate its statues
look the child is in the house with the woman
his protection is at the back of the giving of his powers
"ipet second month """" day 9 """""
large wreaths of gold
then as the prince of bakhtan was asleep on his bed
searching what was beneficial to his father amun
they had not imagined the things i did
and clothing
a royal offering of osiris
of re harakhte
filled with water to its edge
he will stay close to me on the day of suffering
the vizier was in a state of joy when he saw the beautiful face of his mother
the one who is with him
and he sees the darkness of a north wind arise
i inundated a pond
and gave him very many gifts of every good thing
may he live forever
born of
the officials who were appointed to repel evil
there were no deserters
effective of being
your plots of land are in the country
someone who suffers from mucus in his throat
may isdes defend me in the sacred hall
he is more devouring in his moment than fire
never had anything similar been done by a king
without letting him know
so that you may be persistent at it
who strikes the southerners and beheads the northerners
all who live in this town
the one with powerful arm who tramples his enemies
gold horus great of strength rich in power
is eating my barley
and clothes end nakedness
be careful that you do not run aground while at the tiller
that id found obliterated upon the doorways
for the spirit of the revered
begotten by the scribe of the great prison senebni
if justice does not attend to him when he is robbed
but to his majesty himself it was revealed
now it was the majesty of this august god
so that they may give their excellent counsel
gold horus justified
his majesty commanded the digging of this canal after his finding it blocked up with stones
the princess ahmose
never was anything like that brought to any king
my monuments within this city were greater that those of my forefathers
and strangle fowl for you
he who attacks you is the one they have condemned
that grow in punt
in joy
he nourishes who is loyal to him
who purifies the place of the great ennead
and they said to his majesty
but she did not turn back
your arms are stronger than all lands
and found bentresh possessed by a spirit
in fat of pintail duck
which means it is made to thrive
death is in my sight today
his majesty commanded that an expedition went with me to this august land
lord of busiris
and all their weapons
until your condition reaches faultlessness
tell me what you would do about it
begotten by kamutef
a great one of the king of upper egypt
lacuna in text
and instructions were heard from the great throne
that his heart desires
a thirsty mans approach of water
before it has found a way out
i didnt know whether i was dead or alive
like someone in his pyramid
and this peasant said
a 4 nw the 4th door
the revered the gods father ity says
the king content with everything
then re said
what was ordered to me to be done there happened thoroughly
without failing
i placed your two sisters as protection behind you
you should do outstanding things
in the favour of your city gods
born of khyt
you attained them
and i will let his majesty go to bakhtan to save the daughter of the prince of bakhtan
how joyful is the one to whom this is said
the revered singer tjeniaa
who creeps in
to the cabinet
from the provinces of lower egypt
in the kingdom of the two banks of horus
esteemed assistant and great chief of ma hedi
in her turmoil a canal is made for her
that i didnt think i would survive
fight for his name
these three boats
while his majesty was in thebes
and fowl
and as director of works in karnak
when the sky is hot
he placed me in front of his children
that one came to say to his majesty
even more than accomplishing what he came for
creator who wasnt created
two ladies living of birth
rally every heart to excellence
before khons the provider in thebes and the spirit
he made it something greater than itself
who developed his beauty in the body of niut
having taught himself knowledge
who did good to his equal
then he will pass it
i did it and you advanced me
a man speaks to another
by sailing north or by land
and this peasant came to plead with him for a fifth time
he gave to her what the sun revolves around and what geb and nut surround
and an apron to the motherless
there was no discontented face in hermopolis
patricians were wailing
after he had loaded his donkeys
whom he loved
bright of face good of character
and raised him up
then isis said
the like had not happened before
and on his tomb of the necropolis
and i induced cheers in the western deserts
it adorned the water
yours is what this horizon veils
a haul of catfish
it is the staff who would cheer
finding none who would defy him
in the season of harvest
one who should hear deaf
the king of upper and lower egypt khakheperre
nehri justified and revered
treasurer
while they lie in their blood
year 50 first month of the season of harvest day 22
oxen
that malabathrum that you said would be brought
and love to one who doesnt forget him
and who is not touched by the gruesomeness thereof
i took the crops away from them
it was as a dreaming state
in distress
given life
ushering me
then her uncle said to her
he has said about it
the rooms of the house
and khnum made his body healthy
1/64 flour of dates
his joy is his attacking barbarians
your majesty is conquering horus
whose southern borders reach to the crest of the world
there is no tomb for him-who-rebels against his majesty
following a statue of 13 cubits of stone
who are in your grasp as far as shat

a royal offering of horus of edfu
daughter who subjugated the lords
she wouldnt come at all

lord of the thrones of the two lands
the scribe listens
son of re tuthmosis shining like re
then he said to me
since i had taken their horses

his rays are on faces like atum in the east of the sky
the one he rejects will be a pauper
it will be supper
examinor of mankind
and the council of the residence
whom amun made great
justified
sons of noted men whose names were well known
given life stability and dominion like re forever
under the majesty of the king of upper and lower egypt menkheperre
because he loved him so much
i didnt give of it to the asiatics
royal decree to follower sinuhe
in his every place
for fear of being seen by
perhaps it is a peasant of his who went to someone else beside him
ruddjedet had a quarrel with the maid
a royal offering
electrum
and there is no mans heart
he is a king valiant like montu
when you set
his house was his fathers house when he was still a child
he gave to her what the sun revolves around and what geb and nut surround
favours towards me were from its great ones
son of re of his body tuthmosis shining in beauty
may he live forever
they heard your battle cry and hid in holes
they heard your battle cry and hid in holes
if an army was sent to palestine
you are like the messenger of khenty
during the towing of the fleet through the eddy
as no fault of mine was found
if you show mercy on a past failure
he achieves only failure
from hatnub
you do not flee
over whom nemti rejoices
they arrived safely in thebes
where i was with my relatives
as he who diminished them
and her titulary was established as great royal wife nefrure
hidden from the troglodytes and foreigners
the foreign land extracts for me everything good that is in it
your tongue is the pointer of the balance
who is pregnant with three children of re lord of sakhbu
in the vicinity of the pyramid
son of re of his body tuthmosis shining like re given life
none missing
look i am under way without a ship
i will make you know yourself to be ashes
one with powerful arm the like of whom has never been
as you live for me
as son of a count into the inheritance
i am one who says what is good and repeats what is loved
who were brought as prisoners
it is the evil man who destroys his home ground
ity born of satsobek
and they couldnt go out for fear of the bull
he sees me as you are doing when you open
who are in your grasp as far as shat
lord of the thrones of the two lands
will end by being given to a stranger
