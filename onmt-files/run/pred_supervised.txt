i will not speak
existing
who enters the foreign lands
he who should mitigate is causing suffering
whom can i talk to today
it was learned of by hearsay
everyone
then it was recounted
how good she is
the season of growing
all the gods
acolytes
mistress of the two lands
may you perish
lord of abydos
before i have come to it
overseer of the granaries of amun
may he live forever
whose equal has never been
you are with me
born of thoth
may you become less like a ravenous crocodile

prince regent
but not to a tomb for the woman
lord of the gods amun lord of the thrones of the two lands
to its entirety

your servant is in a state of joy on account of your words
with honey
he appointed me as overseer of the granaries of amun
ikhernofret priest
you will reach the residence where you grew up
for i am laden with sorrow
then the majesty of this god said
and dont listen to anyone who is against him
about the decree of the plan for the masses
of those who attacked him
to their towns
you are the steering oar of the land in its entirety
sharper than a heart of speech
then that enemy and the princes who were with them had sent
then his majesty said
alabaster
she appointed him as bread who went on to the road
a daughter of the great ones of naharina
the numerous army of metjen was overthrown within an hour
that is in the residence of this tomb

i overthrew them as he ordered in the way that he used to do
live like re forever
on account of my neighbour
his majesty spent the day of a day of celebration
the goodness of a good man is good to him
on the eyes
and asiatics will not bury you
in his heart
then the prince of bakhtan stood in his hand
and this nemtinakht said
you have erected my sanctuary as a work of eternity
to the northern to the residence
but the hindermost will reach land
writing of the fields of horus of edfu
then may you do evil
may they take as much myrrh as they wish
for her labour is her arms for her arms
who judges without partiality
surpassing what he was told before his words
i decked the chest of the lord of abydos
and swallowed for four days
a commoner asks for dinner
but there can be no tomb for one who rebels against his majesty
he is praised for his sheltering
they made for me

now the road on which it travelled was exceedingly difficult
for him who prays to see it come
leader of the work on this statue
it being driven from its inhabitants
so his singer
when the builders became gods
and they fled immediately
and everything that they made to see you

this humble servant seeks counsel from his mouth to a temple
he subjugated what he gave me to the one who is greater than you
the barbarians flee from his barbarians
in the place of judgement

may you bring myrrh apply ointment
when his majesty reached the country of niya
for this large lord of this sarcophagus
to be put in water
cast evil on the ground
you will embrace your children

to whom great ones come while they are bowing
you are hidden from their sight
glorious seed of the six great ones
