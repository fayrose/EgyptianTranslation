Transliteration and translation for The Shipwrecked Sailor, following
the transcription on pp. 41-48 of Blackman (1932). Blackman omitted
positions 77 and 110, which we determined by means of De Buck (1948),
pp. 100-106, and Golénischeff (1912), pp. 1-10.

The transliteration throughout follows Hannig (1995).

For published translations, see Lichtheim (1975), pp. 211-215;
Parkinson (1997), pp. 89-101; Simpson (1972), pp. 50-56. Also
considered where the examples from Allen (2000), Gardiner (1957),
Graefe (1994) and Loprieno (1995).
