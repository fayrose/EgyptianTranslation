Transliteration and translation for Papyrus Westcar (Berlin Papyrus
3033), following the transcription of Blackman (1988). Written between
square brackets are only those transliterations and translations that
correspond to restorations of the hieroglyphic other than those given
on the left-hand side pages of Blackman (1988).

I assume the following correction:

<li>
After 1,22 read <hi>V30</hi> as <hi>W3</hi>.
</li>

The transliteration throughout follows Hannig (1995). Transcription of
personal names, except names of kings given by Hannig (1995), follows
Parkinson (1997).

For published translations, see Lichtheim (1975), pp. 215-222 (covers
only the text after 4,7); Parkinson (1997), pp. 102-127; Simpson
(1972), pp. 15-30; Zonhoven (1992), pp. 273-276 (covers only the text
after 6,22); Chioffi and Rigamonti (2005). Also considered where the
examples from Graefe (1994) and Loprieno (1995).

And this child rushed into <10,25> her arms, a baby of one cubit,

his bones were strong, his limbs were destined to be of gold,

Then Meskhenet approach him

'A king who will perform the kingship in this entire land!'

And Khnum made his limbs healthy.

And they washed him, after his umbilical cord had been cut,

and he was placed on a couch of brick.

These gods then went out,

having delivered Ruddjedet of the three children,

<11,5> and they said:

'Rejoice, Reusre,

Then he said to them:

Then Khnum loaded himself with the barley,

Then <11,13> they created three lordly crowns (l.p.h.!),

They said:

And they put the barley in a sealed room.

Then Ruddjedet became pure in a purification of fourteen days.

Then she said to her maid:

And the maid went <12,1> and opened the room.

Then she heard the noise of singing, music making, dancing, cheering

but couldn't find the place where it was done.

bound with leather.

She put it <12,6> in a room containing her belongings,

Then they sat down for a day of celebration.

Now, when some days had passed after this,

Ruddjedet had a quarrel with the maid

her mood was exceedingly bad.
